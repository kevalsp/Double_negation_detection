1,i do not find very interesting this course too many interview it could work for the first course but not for the second i wa expecting to have more technical material and lesson,1
2,this course doesn t contain any new information it doe not teach you but just excitedly show commonly known fact there are better way to invest your time,1

6,mo comment went way too fast no contact not deep,1
7,if you don t speak chinese it s a terrible course the lecture are recorded from lecture at university and the rhythm is very slow and not very well explained at least the first week the transcription into english are incomplete so understand this course is very very complicated i do not recommend it at all,1
8,it say advanced writing but it is advanced for college student not advanced overall i found it extremely basic,1
9,extremely poor quality of instruction the lecture themselves are little more than the material being read directly off the slide by an individual with a poor grasp on the english language the majority of the slide are wall of unclear and non descriptive text even with reading directly from the slide the lecturer is overly circumstantial in her explanation if not just outright tangential i commend the author for putting together a course outside of their native language but in this case at least it doe more harm than good in short this course ha the air of a group of first year student giving a presentation verbatim from the slide a another commenter also mentioned below,1
10,really poor powerpoint presentation and video half in chinese the accent of the teacher is horrible i m not an english native speaking person so it s hard for me to follow english when badly spoken so i cut off the sound and only read the subtitle the content is interesting though,1
11,after finishing week i have decided to stick with duke university s medical neuroscience which is starting up again i also highly recommend understanding the brain the neurobiology of everyday life which i believe wa taught by the university of chicago i found them to be far more engaging the viewer and the format to be much easier to follow i found it visually disturbing and also have to keep pausing to read the slide before it switch it s too bad because i wa really looking forward to this course it also seemed she had trouble pronouncing many of the word and i do not want to learn how to pronounce many of them incorrectly also many of the slide did not have an english translation on them,1
12,lot of good information but the presentation is very bad not only are the professor clearly struggling with the english and the material calling anatomical plane plate and confounding sulcus with fissure etc but some of the recording video editing decision make it le engaging and more difficult to follow for example the size of the image is often compromised because they chose to show the professor on the left side of the screen even though it is absolutely unnecessary to do so overall i do not recommend this course,1
13,coursea doe not allow me to quit the class also i can not do the homework or watch video at my own pace,1
14,the tutorial is not for average student it take a very high skill to understand them also the quiz nd the assignment r too tough hope you can make them a bit easy the last one ie with graph and tree wa a bouncer if the math required is so high please take a week to first explain the math fresher required in course and then start the main course,1
15,this course should retrieved from coursera it is plenty of mistake one of the quiz is repeated question do not have relation with lecture,1
16,this course is not about excel or mysql this is only about probability distribution binary classification etc so if you re interested in learning some math this is a great course for you but certainly not for learning some basic excel and mysql i am very disappointed and have lost all my money for nothing i did not learn what i had initially thought i will i feel cheated i have lost both time and money at the same time,1
17,the quality of video is not good there is some absurd voice in between also the course for week ha information related to finance which is beyond understanding level of a person with no financial background,1
18,if you are going to try and complete the specialization for this course series i suggest you look elsewhere i wa able to complete the first course with ease but the second course to this specialization felt incomplete and doe not tie in very well with the how excel is used don t be fooled by how easy the first week assignment is for the second course of this specialization my initial rating for this course alone wa star but due to the lack of effort and information in the nd course of this specialization i have to give this star a these course are all tied together,1
19,i an very disappointed that duke hit your up for just to grade the fist quiz which should cost them this is the fist time i have seen an institution do this i can understand charging for a certificate or for a final project but not right out of the gate i hope that the spirit of coursera is not changing to a pay to play site there are other higher rated university that take a more noble approach i wonder if all the reviewer paid day for this class or did duke recently changed their pricing policy after the review,1
20,coursera doe not want to give me a certificate i ve got for this course,1
21,i think this course if poorly organized the instructor is really trying to show u that the real life data set and database are messy but providing only written instruction for me it proved useless i for one need to see what other people are doing and not read long page of horrible written explanation i paid for the course just to be able to do the exercise which i also think it s a minus all in all it didn t enhance my career prospect mostly because nothing useful wa taught here wouldn t recommend anyone to pay for it,1
22,this course is too much doggy please do not use coursera for advertising your friend company or at least learn how to do it a little more professionally to look really relevant this psychiatric lady also seems to be sexits looking at difference between picture with a girl and picture with a boy is really abominable and show an intentional discrimination and racism it is really shameful,1
23,the technical support of this course is just terrible just like many many other student see the discussion forum i have experienced serious difficulty to access the database platform we need to learn and to complete our assignment i can only echo the innumerable complains from my co student about the lack of efficient support and technical reliability of this course many of u are very unhappy about this especially a they have paid for this course and what is coursera doing about it by the way my advice beware before enrolling in this course and even in this entire specialization and search for alternative option there are many not only on coursera but also on edx and others,1
24,it is very interesting but we have to face problem with teradata i have not been able even to log in and a lot of student are in the same situation and the problem persists even in the duedate of the test,1
25,yeah i would give zero if possible very shallow and general can not learn much from it if u want a course about neuroscience there s way better course than this what the hell emory what hte hell coursera i feel le and le sincerity in coursera s mooc these day edx is doing a much better job in my perspective,1
26,could ve learnt this on youtube really not very good dr egger s course are rigorous and full of math this is just a bunch of pretty picture shouldn t be included in this specialization,1
27,the course content is itself interesting but the lack of active mentor to provide guidance make the course really difficult to learn so many unanswered question on the discussion board and many confused student i am so glad i am not paying for this course,1
28,online grader for lab is terribly buggy attempted submitting lab several occasion all fail local build work fine with apps working a expected and test pas the online builder give very little feedback other than buiderror wasted will not recommend and will never fall for it again avoid,1
29,very fast pace with no support be prepared to make countless online search or to discus solely with peer many drop out by the end of the course final project is far too difficult for this course because it did not prepare me at all if you want to learn android programming i suggest you look elsewhere,1
30,too many lecture specialized audience with huge competition not accessible by novice of philosophy and only assessed through a single peer reviewed assignment essay,1
31,i did not know what wa going on and i have to stop,1
32,not good a usual one the code you provided can not work i had to debug againand the instruction for the assignment are not concrete a the last two course,1
33,linking programming language to hardware suck do not waste time on this course,1
34,i don t need the teacher to read aristotle for me reading is not teaching,1
35,i took all previous course in this series and they were all great but suddenly coursera ha changed it policy and one can not take course for free anymore if you just want to learn and gain knowledge without chasing the certificate than the course is useless because you can t receive feedback for your work,1
36,the teacher there do not do what they teach they rattle down their text a fast a they can speak and do not emphasize the content with movement or even change of expression i wa disappointed,1
37,waste of time and i did not learn anything from this course it is basically week of the facilitator asking question without offering much in the form of answer,1
38,such lame quiz i can not pas them although i know this material in my sleep because the english is so bad and ha so many ambiguity there are no single answer to a question instead you need the check the correct answer which are phrased in s misleading way and one little mistake fails the whole question so i try and try and try and never get all the correct check for the specific question so i just fail and retry and fail and retry this is so frustrating i consider i will unroll this course same because i know all this material,1
39,irrationally difficult and inexplicably sloppy having taken first business metric for data driven company i had high hope that it would be on the same level well i wa wrong it wa extremely messy jumping around from definition to definition with little to no explanation and there wa a general lack of motivation from professor egger s part apart from week that had some necessary basic knowledge of excel all of the next week lesson were fast paced beyond a beginner s comprehension by week i had lost the motivation to go on and wa only able to finish it through a great deal of trial and error on the quizzesi would not recommend it unless you have some basic knowledge of the economic theory used in this lesson,1
40,if you do not have a background in statistic do not expect to pas this course,1
41,this is more of an introduction to statistic lesson than one in excel not what i had signed up for,1
42,i dislike this course because i have to complete so many assignment in one week instruction could have improved and slide could have improved rather than using chalkboard sorry there are a number of time i have to rewatch the video and still dont understand hence i even have to place myself in another slot because i could not finish the assignment please improve on this module so that it is more enjoyable for learner who really want to learn thank you,1
43,the concept here are useful and mr egger is a knowledgeable instructor but this class is really about gathering information with excel a the tool you aren t learning anything about excel functionality so the title of this course is really misleading if you just want to become a stronger user in excel there is a huge disconnect between the video lesson and the excel worksheet used to complete the assignment and since many previous reviewer mentioned this it seems like that s not going to change the disconnect between the lesson and the assignment wouldn t be an issue if the instructor could be bothered to respond to forum question mine sat unanswered for day a the deadline passed you are not going to get support if you dont understand something,1
44,really unhappy with how difficult and over complicated it is i came here to learn about excel pivot table function the course really loses focus and it unfortunate that i am now stuck here and can not continue the entire specialization,1
45,misleading course name title wa expecting a course on using excel forum were cluttered and not monitored often,1
46,really wanted to take this class unfortunately i believe it is more about advanced statistic then excel it wa advertised a a beginner class and that is not the case i recommend having a significant knowledge of statistic before taking this course i m a year senior level accounting executive and i wa easily spending to hour a week plus watching the video or time each in order to understand the content it wa very difficult to understand disappointing,1
47,poorly coordinated lecture reference to resource that are not provided no response at least for day on end when question are posted on the forum,1
48,no relevance to specialisation do not expect to get through this if you have not taken multiple statistic course at university level or higher math barely any practical application doe not prepare you for final project,1
49,concept are fantastic but the material developed to deliver the course is short of expectation especially from a university excel sheet do not match what is demonstrated in video lecture lot of confusion around how to complete task quiz answer option not being correct and missing excel spreadsheet e g video lecture say to refer to accompanying excel spreadsheet but no spreadsheet available also judging from past discussion by student some inconsistency around formula being presented in video lecture versus assignment question could have been a great course but the inconsistency have made is very disappointing,1
50,interesting statistical concept and great theory however the lecture and the quiz do not prepare the student well for the final project,1
51,the title is very misleading excel is an afterthought for this course instead there is a heavy focus on statistic the class claim to be for beginner but that is clearly not the case a it requires previous knowledge in inferential statistic and calculus excel is hardly used and is certainly not the focus there are week where excel is not used at all there are no practice assignment only quiz it s clear that this course is outdated and poorly maintained a the video refer to example that are not included or content that wa not presented needle to say i will not be taking any other course in this specialization,1
52,the course structure is not thoughtfully prepared there is a lot of confusion around what the instructor want to say the practice quiz and course content have no match whatsoever,1
53,content is not well organized video are disconnected from one another explanation are not clear spreadsheet contain vast information that is not explained anywhere it is been quite difficult to follow through the course and i bet many student are giving up,1
54,this course is definitely not for beginner you must have intermediate to advanced knowledge of statistic and math i had to resort to google and khan academy extensively just to grasp the concept in this course this course also doe not teach you everything about excel let alone master it you just refer to pre made excel sheet for quiz thats it good luck figuring those out,1
55,complex concept e g regression which can not be taught in such a short course format i know from extensive prior training are taught here in an arcane way i don t know how student without prior knowledge on these topic e g regression roc curve analysis could possibly understand this when taught this way course is also in an early draft mode with plenty of mistake in the video slide the course and specialization really tarnish instead of enhancing this institution s outside image and reputation really a deception sorry i took this class and specialization a complete waste of my time and money the initial presentation wa misleading and i have found online many people sharing the same feeling,1
56,too advanced not enough excel,1
57,unfortunately the material and lecture of this course fell short of my expectation lecture don t follow a logical path and are all over the place and some concept are not expanded a required overall i believe they need to improve how the content is presented and how it s applied in a real world context,1
58,wa very frustrated with this course doe not have a strong emphasis on excel skill and the statistic model provided seem to be randomly chosen and poorly explained quiz were interesting but time consuming because of the necessary extra research outside of provided lecture,1
59,i would not recommend this course it wa very poorly planned and seemed thrown together,1
60,way too much video and too little hand on learning felt like the course mostly taught you to remember stuff and not actually learning a skill though i broke the course early,1
61,us r with no explanation why doe it use a challenging programming language that is not the point the point is to learn statistic use statcrunch so student can focus on statistic not programming,1
62,i love the main lecture of the statistic the subject is fun after couple lecture my mind wa very clear but most of the time i m working on the statistic software name r i think it would be better if require r knowledge if not student like me will need more than week to get use to r i don t mean learn another software is bad idea i will always like to learn something new that s why i go mooc what i mean is r and basic statistic should be separated first r than basic statistic or first basic statistic than r i really enjoy the class but the extra is a bit heavy for me,1
63,good lecture but the r lab is horrible do not take this class,1
64,this class assumes a lot of statistical knowledge and background that is not covered in the first three class of the series so much statistical terminology and jargon wa used by the instructor it felt like taking a class in another language where i had to constantly stop the video and google for the terminology she used it took a lot of grit to finish the class which wa overall a very demoralizing and negative experience,1
65,this course is not well presented lecture are unimaginative and there isn t enough supporting material or reading,1
66,this course offered nothing significant or new to anyone who ha spent any time around business or government negotiation it really seems a though the instructor either assumes all of her student are completely inept or that because it is a free course that producing a reasonably viable product is not necessary,1
67,teacher talk much too slowly and us many complex term when they are not needed,1
68,more practical application would be helpful in solidifying knowledge concept seem abstract outside of any programming practice additionally flow of lecture seems scattered at time concept are introduced then not expounded upon this creates a distracted learning path that make it difficult to follow the lesson from a beginner programmer s view,1
69,i find the week of this course completely irrelevant also i m attending course on coursera to learn and quiz are imo an essential part of that process but definitely not essay for me personally essay are just waste of time and there s nothing beneficial about them another thing that bug me is how questionably and often misleadingly are thermodynamical law interpreted by the professor in this course,1
70,course is not good at all the instructor assumes that you have a good genomic background,1
71,no star another boring animal class that i would not recommend the teacher do seem nice and well educated however it is still too boring and slow for me,1
72,too many animal mistreatment clip were shown also some gross misstatement of biological scientific truth and widely held fact human can not change the genome of any living creature dog are wolf and always will be we have domesticated and bred for certain personality trait and characteristic done with your course,1
73,i am very disappointed about the content it is not a course pr david germano is just reading text no design no learning experience i would learn much better with just reading a book it is a shame i wa very interested in the subject,1
74,too much theoretical probably this is not the course i wa looking for when i joined it nevertheless i will try to get some concept from it particularly for what concern the practice of meditation and mindfulness,1
75,not very good audio,1
76,far too academic nothing of substance but list i m not here for monotonous lecture,1
77,i submitted homework for week i get an email telling me i did not submit then week two the course make reference to material not covered in week it look like a week is missing between week and week,1
78,after the first week the instructor never showed up to answer a single question in the forum the capstone project itself wa disappointing i learned much more from doing my own app in class i took the coursera android specialization which wa eon better than this i would not recommend this io specialization to anyone i would never again take a mooc from u of toronto,1
79,course material is very poor and did not give much support for doing assignment,1
80,a a manager in an it consultancy i can t justify sending my personnel through this course even at per course the amount of information gained is very thin and doe not move one toward being productive,1
81,the last peer review is really hard to do hard is because the wording is very ambiguous and not all understand how to review there wa a guy who answered with sql query this is hardcore since we have not learned that yet,1
82,very basic the hand on exercise are not very hand on and do not actually add much value,1
83,hard to follow not because it is difficult but the lecture is only slide text reading slide very boring and not so many hand on instruction only thing i remember is the instructor s face after finish this class dont know why you add this into such a good specialist,1
84,compared to the other coursera course i attended this one is by far the least useful one the instructor is super brief and his slide are mostly made of a list of acronym i would not recommend it until they make some serious change to the content and presentation of material,1
85,lecture too focus on the theory that not very useful on business world the bi tool microstrategy used in the homework is too slow and crash from time to time,1
86,the material and the lecture is not so engaging,1
87,worst course ever i stopped partway through too many link to outside stuff test quiz were not based on what wa presented in the lesson test design is horrible too many negative question glance over the good true information about nutrition to tell u about free range farm farmer market etc which most people do not have access to or can not afford giving it star is being nicepeople who sponsored it should get their money back,1
88,the course content is okay and cover the basic well enough however the assignment are structured for memorization not learning and contribute little to the experience i decided to cancel my subscription a there are better option on edx and other coursera course,1
89,i can not complete the course due to installation problem of the software required even if i have all the requirement needed on my laptop,1
90,language is not good and lack of info,1
91,honestly for the price paid the value given is quite low i expected to have more hand on working with the hadoop ecosystem rather than this course s focus on background that really doe not help one to become productive,1
92,le useful than reading an introductory chapter being able to reiterate acronym or idiosyncratic mnemonic doe not demonstrate any real understanding of this field the minimal information provided and low level of the instruction at least clarified that this specialization is not worth pursuing,1
93,very disappointing poorly written quiz and presentation the level of the course is far too basic to be of value but is required for the specialization why not offer an option to test out of basic introduction course,1
94,extremely basic intro not valuable if you have any understanding of the the space,1
95,the instructor keep repeating the same information throughout all the lecture it is not a impactful a i thought it would be the last straw wa her saying that that wa an article,1
96,very low quality and not practical,1
97,this course is not designed well,1
98,i think this course is great i like everything about it but i can t say the same about the quiz format it is rigid and non standardi gave up on the course many time because of thishow do write sqrt for instance x must be x or it is not acceptable i am sorry this is pretty bad,1
99,this course is not good in giving lesson with example that will help a with studying for the quiz,1
100,did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two function but had it on the first quiz,1
101,a total waste of time not challenging at all in any aspect it wa quite funny that many word problem were identical with only some parameter changing buckeye please try harder next time,1
102,very disappointing course far too much repetition a lot of opinion based on scant evidence it would have been much better a a minute video without all the fluff and unsubstantiated inference i would not recommend this course,1
103,this course is badly structured with proposed task not being well oriented and video where teacher are constantly doubting and making mistake not really happy with it,1
104,poor material terrible french accent not a good android course at all i don t raccoment it unless you re a total novice at android development,1
105,not exciting instructor too stiff and looked like reading a paper,1
106,it us mixed material from other platform meant for pure python programming learning jump between section in the external platform going forward and back so it pretty confusing to find problem involving content that you have no chance to know if you do not have previous experience with python i would not recommend this course for beginner in programming,1
107,very badly linked with other website that provide the actual content this is more like a click bait setup than the actual course i m not sure why it s even offered on coursera other than to make money on a more popular website using the content hosted by le popular one very bad experience,1
108,again a course that come with very simple and not always good prepared video lecture but for recieving a grade an enormous math knowledge is necessary with no further help given,1
109,the quality of this course is very low and the content are not interesting and useful at all,1
110,quiz kept requiring information that wa oddly specific needing an exact decimal number without multiple choice option which would have been okay except that it wa not covered in the lecture ended up dropping course because there is no way to get through the quiz if the information is not covered,1
111,i wa unhappy with this it wa clear that this course wa pulled together from a superset of other material and that it wa not checked for consistency or completeness the student were tested on their ability to write down a specific phrase from a video rather than on application of the principle learned from utilization of the graph database tool broccoli really further the lack of response to question posted in the forum indicates a lack of engagement from instructor and or facilitator,1
112,the material on graph analytics wa of introductory level a string of interesting idea with unclear explanation the lesson on graphx wa basically a copy paste introduction to it s ability without actually teaching how to use it the transcript are full of mistake someone not proficient in english or hard of hearing would be confused by them it wa somewhat difficult to understand the main lecturer the best part wa the explanation of neo j and it wa at an introductory level a disappointment,1
113,i can not take the quiz because of money the other course let u take the quiz without paying money i dislike you paying policy please let u take the test without money payment sincerely garik,1
114,only an introduction which wa also not proper,1
115,it s almost desk work not practical,1
116,not of a worth,1
117,the information is not presented well and the math is not always taught,1
118,redundant poor explanation and a complete lack of example about the general concept and the foundation of this discipline the interaction between the teacher and the slide is limited to a reading exercise that doe not provide any add value at all very dissapointed and still wondering if this course is worth my attention and extremely limited time or not plenty of room for improvement,1
119,i have sat through of the lesson and i am not very impressed i fell that the topic is very interesting but the professor doe not do a very good job explaining the algorithm it may be because i do no have the textbook but overall a rather poor course there need to be a little more explanation beyond the slide,1
120,this course deserves no start there were no instructor answering the many question raised by the student there were no explanation for wrong answer and so no opportunity to learn i wa helping other student understand the assignment and spent extra time grading submission a no teaching assistant were available to help there were a couple of very good teacher in the specialization however the structure is critically flawed and your time would be better spent studying on your own avoid not just the capstone but this entire series,1
121,bad course thing mentioned by the instructor are naive according to my knowledge my knowledge about chinese philosophy come from a history of chinese philosophy youlan feng history of chinese philosophy sze kwang lao that is not chinese philosophy at all,1
122,i think this course ha very interesting information but it need a way better format it need agile presentation better infographics graphic and design and to be much more flexible and fun i have not finished it but it doe not make me get involved in the content even it is very interesting it need a better script and handling of the information to be able to conect with new student,1
123,very disappointed with the information provided i went through the second week completing all assignment and quiz but did not learn anything new most of the information provided is common knowledge anymore i wa also a little put off by the frequent self promotion by the instructor in reference to his treatment center organization and book i am withdrawing from the class,1
124,it absolutely amazing course i personally benefit a lot really it s not just the certificate thank you coursera for this huge chance,1
125,the lecture are unpolished and hard to follow especially a the caption are inaccurate the mathematics in the course are not explained clearly,1
126,this course offered many interesting idea about flipping school classroom but offered no suggestion about the practical method to do so a a teacher i need to have realistic suggestion about the technology necessary to flip my math class not a series of testimonial about how great it s going to be once my class is flipped,1
127,i did not find that this course added anything to what i already learned seems mainly a re hash of prior material slimly disguising marketing pitch of other northwestern course,1
128,the structure of the lecture is not really effective,1
129,i would not recommend this course because the video lesson are quite poor the teacher mostly read note from his ipad without a proper presentation or some kind of text,1
130,i found it very easy but if you do not know anything about autism i think you might would contribute from it,1
131,the video are too longassignments are difficultand dr asfahani is not like dr larryi loved dr larry much moredr asfahani is not interesting in his presentation at all,1
132,instructor speaks too slow and sometimes hardly audible with my earphone plugged in with sound incredibly slow paced coffee must too much of story and history and introduction much le material presented for concept shown much of the lecture time is wasted on thing which doe not matter for example djikstra shortest path i would be more interested to know about the algorithm than a huge lecture on who is djikstra and also would like to have some exercise to implement the same and realise very unsatisfied with the course but there is no other course offered for c programming language in english language not worth the time,1
133,i am highly disappointed with the policy of providing the homework only to the paid participant it seems this is gearing towards another mean of making bussiness when it come to education i understand that grading and providing feedback requires effort and the fee charged is required to the cover those cost but like before we must have an option to get access to the homework allowing u to apply our learning while it maybe be acceptable not to have any feedback or certificate on the course completion currently the closed homework policy go against the basic objective of mooc and i hope it is reconsidered,1
134,i ve already written a review for part and i have the same opinion about this one the course is rather poor and not challenging only general information about relevant topic that a well read on wikipedia no exercise no code assignment a lot of this content wa repeated from first two part of this specialization,1
135,i had a very poor experience being graded by peer although the capstone project assignment itself is excellent the peer grading rubric is not i wa not fairly graded and i am sure of this,1
136,i have studied some bayesian statistic before i feel like the material itself is not sufficient for entry level and will actually confuse some of the learner anyway this is just my two cent,1
137,complete garbage item not really presented in relevant detail with respect to standard industry practice what you will learn here is not how thing are done on the job,1
138,not very applicable just a bunch of concept it feel like a very disorganised course paul harris is extremely repetitive and take so much time to get to the point sometimes he over explains unnecessary thing his lecture need serious upgrade lecturer speak too slow i have to use the x speed not to fall asleep,1
139,inattentive lecture there re only a few video that are worth watching you need to be prepared for wasting a lot of time for programming assignment it s not because the assignment are tough but because of poor description and out of sync with lecture if you re interested just download the online material not video and read through it much better than wasting your time with the lecture video and assignment,1
140,margaret meloni wa constantly looking down to read directly from a poorly rehearsed script while trying to stumble through phrasing and lecture point considering this is a course about communication this wa very disappointing the quiz were vague and either didn t have clear correct answer or didn t feel applicable to the module to which it wa assigned after reviewing the material i had to complete the quiz by trial and error since the answer were not reflected in the lecture,1
141,i thought it wa going to be good did the first week video and lecture but i feel cheated because it will not let me take the quiz to move on without paying for the course no where did i ever see anything that said ahead you had to pay if you didn t want a certificate or to do the whole specialization coursera used to be a platform i used and recommended no more,1
142,can not believe uci have just very short course compared to san diegi duke virginia copnehagan who have course worthing thousand of dollar for free a compared to this one uci have exception course in objective c which is worth the money to be paid but this series are extremely below the expected standard,1
143,i tried giving zero star this course is very poor in particular the last portion of the class wherein you are tested on thing that were not taught if i had wanted to spend hour in google trying to learn this stuff i would not have spent money on this course,1
144,the course content is very poorly explained the quiz question don t really test what wa taught in the lecture and the assignment are just copying and pasting thing i feel like i still have a very poor understanding of what wa supposedly covered in the course i can not generalise or apply the learned information or skill to other topic or research because i didn t actually understand the core concept or how to use the program,1
145,this is another course in ucsd s big data introductory course the material is not pertinent to a specialty on big data technology further the course doe not increase one s knowledge of machine learning in any way that justifies spending the time in the course,1
146,unfortunately this course consists of the professor reading his note very quickly with rapid listing of concept and very little time spent explaining complex topic the quiz emphasize the term for various element of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tool to analyze data there doe not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistake in quiz question and question asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone i wa committed to working with the course but by week it wa unfortunately impossible to absorb and there wa no way to interact with anyone to get help i m sure there is room for improvement on this course and i hope the instructor doe work to improve with the course but currently the course is disappointing a a learning experience,1
147,this course is a total scam in doubt sign up for the free version and go watch the video each video is only minute long so you can watch all week in half an hour speed o i forgot they also include a link to a year old ted talk fun but not really relevant this course is a disgrace to coursera it ought to be removed,1
148,introduction video each week and ton of link for reading do not want the worst course i ever took not enough video material with good explanation all we got link to article which we can found ourselves without any help,1
149,i expected much more the course material is really weak did not improve my knowledge about cyber security i am very disappointed also co i payed dollar to a certificate i do not recommend this course,1
150,this is not a course each session is min or le,1
151,i wish they spent more time on the content of video and le on the silly effect and second intro and outro sequence practically every question of the final come word for word from a book not assigned in the module reading and not available for free to student for them to study i won t be taking any other course from this school if this course wa an indication of quality,1
152,i did not find the lecture at all informative and the reading were not targeted enough to understand what item required focus and what information wa more background i did not find the course especially helpful,1
153,video content barely summarizes the outline of each module the question in the quiz are not though provoking peer discussion are rather superficial and do not cover half the content of the course reading are ok show good source but there is no real discussion about them in the video or in the quiz,1
154,minimal video effort not enough content and long reading definetly not a good course to get a verified certificate,1
155,very confusing course unclear example too theoretical very limited relevancy to business question also presentation format could be improved table are not intuitive to read understand,1
156,this review doe not reflect the course content the new coursera ui make it impossible to download transcript or slide of the video without these feature following the lecture is significantly more difficult and i can t rate this course any higher than star i would rate it zero star if that wa possible,1
157,worse than the first course i expected something that is not academic like explanation which i can t find it here please bring back those explanation style similar to the first course,1
158,i found the wording of the assignment really difficult to follow so i didn t really understand what wa expected of me i spend a lot of time and therefore money on this course but in the end i made a conscious decision to stop i wa taking it for personal pleasure and it wa not worth the stress each week of trying to work out what wa being asked i have taken a number of other course in creative writing elsewhere and other course on coursera this is the first one i have actively chosen to stop because i just wasn t engaging with it either for education or for enjoyment,1
159,is this a real course for a data scientist just installing shit and a peer reviewing for that screenshot and forking all repos very bad not worth to be with rest course in specialization,1
160,the course is not updated,1
161,this should not be a course in itself,1
162,quiz were based off of extremely high level overview video not covering anything specifically or deep diving into anything when applying the git command covered numerous error arose overwhelmingly academic course with very little hand on this is not for anyone actually looking to work in this field but for someone looking to be able to talk about this field,1
163,the course doe not warrant the price it ha way too little information very dissatisfied,1
164,certainly not worth paying for this course only talk about how to install the tool not able to take quiz when you try to take the course for free,1
165,although the content is correct quality model video and material is very low wanted to make all the specialization but i m not satisfied with the quality of the course it s a shame because the jhu is an excellent university,1
166,too basic content i have not learned anything with this course installing r and rstudio should not be part of exercise or lecture i hope r programming course will be better,1
167,not really enough content to be a course in it s own right should be additional material a is useful but definitely not a requirement,1
168,this wa advertised a a six week course but the deadline make it a two week course the assignment are exceptionally challenging given that the instructor offer now actual instruction on how to perform them two and a half day into the course not a single moderator ha answered a question in the forum and i can t find a way to contact coursera about this problem i am very disappointed i wa planning on taking additional course through the coursera platform but now i am reconsidering,1
169,i am disappointed because the course doesn t provide profound material on data analysis with python the video are too short and the sample demonstrated in the video aren t thoroughly explained for instance the speaker often only say what she is doing but not why she is doing it or what the function of a particular parameter is i felt left alone and forced to google in my opinion it can not be the purpose to make your student google basic thing that could easily be integrated into the course considering that this is labelled a a beginner course i wa expecting much more theoretical input other course offer additional slide and script that are aligend with the course video and allow the student to look thing up,1
170,totally just marketing material don t waste your time with this school at all you can not learn a program in a couple of minute,1
171,very disappointed about this course the topic is very interesting for me at least but the course organization is horrible lecture do not provide enough information to complete the assignment zero interaction from course staff issue with getting assignment graded in previous session the staff just refered you to the coursera helpdesk but you can not easily contact coursera directly main focus of course seems to be earning money and not educating be warned and don t pay for this course i really don t get why this course ha so many good review,1
172,bad material poor graphic wrong mc question in video more hype content than a course this is not the way to learn python seriously don t take this one,1
173,it wa not w,1
174,not what i expected though the lecturer quite patronising and the exercise too juvenile did not finish the course so it may have improved after the first few session thank you,1
175,elementary school level program not college or university,1
176,the course delivery is regrettably boring the second break don t work very well the lecturer is not trying to be engaging or at least pleasant to listen to i hope he lecture this way in the attempt of being clear however it come across a being very monotonous and boring i had a strong motivation to follow the course but honestly had to drop without completing the second lecture a missed opportunity,1
177,lesson no longer available via pclesson no longer exist to do via pc on internet sugggested it ha been removed can not go ahead without having the lesson information,1
178,the assignment do not give you any practical method for actual problem solving they re just a succession of activity that pretend to be creative by making you do thing you wouldn t normally do it s like they forgot the part about problem solving the assignment are to eat food you ve never eaten talk to people you wouldn t normally talk to take a photo of yourself smooching someone something and to give something to someone you never have given anything before that is not creative nor helpful at problem solving it s just a series of activity for people who have too much time on their hand and need something to do to get out of their routine not a course i would recommend for anyone wanting to gain useful skill,1
179,not a course that help you solve wicked problem which do not have solution that will come suddenly one fine day and one that require more thought effort and brainstorming,1
180,i m sorely disappointed i learned almost nothing valuable and found the content to be so basic that i didn t get a good feel for tableau i paid elsewhere udemy and i m learning a shit ton about tableau through them tableau ha great free resource too that are better than what i paid for on coursera this class is a joke and not worth a a ucd alumnus i m embarrassed my school s name is on this,1
181,very basic in term of material covered would be nice a a free remedial class in prep for the main specialization homework assignment were confusing and did not appear to have been reviewed by the instructor before being sent to student main problem the free software student use wa not the same version a that being used to develop the homework instructor support wa not evident in the user forum below the quality of the free class taken in the past,1
182,they say that if you don t have anything good to say it s better not to say anything at all,1
183,this is a good course for deciding if you want to pursue a more advanced degree in cryptography computer science or mathematics but a part of a cyber security specialization your paying customer are most likely working professional engineer or programmer interested in practical application of cryptography that they can use in order to create secure system and service this is a mathematics course and your paying customer are not going to use the knowledge from this course in their job this is not an indictment of the instructor but of the content itself it is the wrong content for your target customer,1
184,too mechanistic not much creative module,1
185,in my opinion this is not a course the content are a short interview cut up over week fluffed with a myriad of vendor biased pdfs the s classroom style video editing is annoying to boot,1
186,in wk my db is totally messed up and i do not know where to find the correct create statement to recreate the db that the assignment expect it shouldn t be too difficult to provide one page that give the command to execute to create the db that is used in each week for each week separately due to that i m un enrolling from this course,1
187,assingnments are not grading so i do not have reason to study something that can t finish,1
188,severe lack of support zero from the professor or ta some wrong solution were provided for assigments but were never addressed or acknowledged that it will be fixed some assignment file are not mac friendly or is just not viewable by all student i can t tell material are quite good but grading is subject to broad interpretation and there is no human to provide guidance on what are the best practice to think that i paid for the specialisation in order to take the graded assignment and i have to do the grading but i do not receive support this is ridiculous i will have to think three time before i pay for a coursera course in the future never again i will not recommend this to others,1
189,course material wa interesting but very rudimentary the course biggest challenge wa understanding it spoken english i do not recommend this course,1
190,the lecture are very well organized the topic are also cover in this field however the lecture are very dry and boring the main professor were reading the script on the monitor from my perspective with his knowledge in this field a being described on his personal web site he should be able to talk comfortably by looking at the topic on the slide then discus about it in detail i would suggest to change the environment to be at the wide open space like coffee shop to make this course more attractive i m sorry it is not what i expected,1
191,too much statistic too much coding and inadequate instruction this is not a coding specialization and if i wanted to learn coding i would have taken a coding course this week course ha been a nightmare,1
192,this is the specialisation that suck all joy out of the entire course month on and i am still on week the software and the provided file are not fully working something is always missing constant error message if you don t have background in statistic you will have a very difficult time,1
193,neither statistic nor r wa covered in any meaningful way at the end of the course you are left with frustration for having to jump through the loop but no understanding of the principle i am a college instructor for statistic having graduated from a phd program even with that background i could not follow the instructor the course designer never considered the audience and never identified the goal of this course the instructor wa lost between teaching r and teaching stats so in the end he did neither worst course i have ever taken both online and face to face,1
194,this wa the most arduous undertaking i have ever been through my frustration is not with professor wobbrock who is obviously an expert in his field though sometimes i felt like he s speaking in high valyrian and not english my disappointment lie with ucsd which included the course of such depth of information and a strong requirement for understanding r without much thought on whether student will be able to follow i feel that going through this course wa largely pointless because i m not going to retain much of the depth of the material in the long run based solely on this experience i m not going to be recommending this specialization to anyone,1
195,disappointed very technical course and not so practical for today s world there is a lot of term and subject that you require a good background in statistic analysis to understand well it is a shame that this take part of the specialization program,1
196,if you do not know r studio or r programming this course will be very difficult for you the fact that they state you dont need to know this program and then require you to use it to complete test is unacceptable week test onward requires you to modify code or program code in order to get statistic required to answer the question their helpful hint cause error when used mainly because you must know the correct syntax or placement of the code to get the correct answer i m very disappointed in this class and probably will not pas because i do not have the time to figure out how to program in r,1
197,overall the video related to the quiz are to vague and un detailed i more often than not feel lost also this should not be part of the interaction design specialisation and just be a small part of another course not once have i needed r or statistic in my year design career,1
198,little to no use for me should not be included in the specialization i didn t sign up for a data class,1
199,not worth the money,1
200,very boring presentation of the material i am sorry to say so but the professor is not a very engaging speaker,1
201,this course totally reminds me of some course back in college unorganized material and the assignment are unrelated to the tutorial the assignment themselves seem to be very helpful but the tutorial did no help of achieving these assignment i had a hard time following the instructor despite that i ve completed all the certificate for python from university of michigan i m aware of my background of python is still not strong enough so i thought it s probably just me not able to learn it fast enough but then i watched the tutorial about sql a a data architect etl developer sql is something i m familiar with and use it everyday and then i realized that the instructor couldn t explain a nested query well the reason i wa able to understand about the sql part is because i already know,1
202,lost in detail professional btw i hold a msc degree in computer engineering can not get anything from this what is the point of writing frequency pl where there is a hist function in r if the instructor is trying to teach u how to program in any language then i can assure you the data science class is not the right place i recommend the instructor check essec business school for analytics subject to better comprehend the coursera and it goal,1
203,i suppose that we should have some basic knowledge of data visualization before this course there are no practical session i could not understand many topic and it seems that content ha been missing from this course,1
204,the course do not match it price at all it is catastrofically sketchy first time while using coursera i am so much unsatisfied with some course,1
205,great material some thing i didn t know about disability and college however the presentation of the video that were not of a guest speaker were poorly done the instructor sounded like robot and you could tell easily that they were just reading from a script,1
206,you have to pay to upload the assigments this doe not pa in other course,1
207,it s too short i think it should be a part of a course and not a course itself it is a repetition of concept and example from other course by john hopkins univ,1
208,this course is very sparse on detail and just a week of content the lecturer is not the best at explaining concept,1
209,in my opinion this course is a waste of time it simply throw a bunch of link and terminology for you to google and research the project is interesting but once again you have to do ton of research and take up other course to fill the gap might a well do the other course instead of this one i do not recommend this course or the specialization,1
210,none of the previous class will prepare you for this one this is not really a class but rather a project on a topic never covered in any of the previous class in this specialization,1
211,a a developer i consider this a very poor course it can be good for manager and business people to better understand what technology are available these day but that it you can easily look at the syllabus go to the wikipedia and read the page on presented subject and you will get the same knowledge there were no programming assignment quiz and exam were not challenging at all and some question were really confusing i won t recommend it to anyone and it shouldn t be part of this specialization,1
212,the teacher and instructor really should make better video and stop giving peer edit assignment when people are picky and do not grade your assignment the instructor should also give their contact to let their student contact them when the discussion forum dont work,1
213,this course is not relevant in the real world,1
214,week and were very useful a a beginner i learned a lot about html and cs week wa a big leap to javascript and the level of difficulty wa the reason why i quit the course concept are not well explained a lot of material for completing the task is missing please make javascript part simple for beginner,1
215,the most terrible course i have ever seen in my life and on this site for some of quiz question you feel like you are dumb because you can not make connection between lecture and quiz i really wanted to learn java on coursera but it seems impossible to me focusing on rbg value and image thingies too much and making me feel uncomfortable at quiz after watching all those lecture are the main reason of giving star,1
216,poorly designed and explained you do not really gain much knowledge from this course i would not recommend my friend and basically others to take this course there are far better course out there for much cheaper price,1
217,this is not a beginner s course there is not enough coverage of fundamental programming concept and too much playing around with complex application concept such a steganography simple image manipulation is a good way to teach programming concept teaching bit arithmetic in a first programming course is not also there are many error in the video that should be corrected and finally this course is advertised a requiring hour per week what a huge underestimate i have been programming professionally since other than week every week requires closer to hour at least stop advertising this a a beginning course or restructure it such that it is more appropriate for beginner,1
218,the instructor overly explain simple concept and talk about programming inbetween make the course confusing then you get lost and quiz you on stuff that wa not properly explaiuned,1
219,tutor reading from a teleprompter come across a robotic lifeless and boring we should be told before we do a piece of work that we can only submit it by upgrading not afterwards,1
220,i quit this course a it doe not live up to the specialization which it begin javascript is not java the course description should clearly state that javascript will be taught and that it will be used to draw box of different color i wa extremely let down by this course,1
221,this is not for beginner at all,1
222,this course is misleading in a lot of way it is not for beginner at all the quiz in the course are beyond impossible the lecture video give an introduction to some concept but you are left on your own to figure everything out they do not provide the proper tool to enable student to understand or pas reading through a lot of the discussion board there are two type of student those like me who have never programmed in their life and can not figure any of this out and those who have all sort of experience and write thing that are way advanced for a beginner course do yourself a favor and seriously do some research on appropriate program before signing up for this one it need to be structured way better than what it is now,1
223,a giant and complete waste of time and month of work and it s all javascript no java worse yet you are required to work in bluej google it with custom javascript function that you are not allowed to view or use outside the course so none of the code you write in this course will ever be able to be used anywhere else the function probably are in a minified file but the student were not given access to that file a complete waste of time i would give it zero star but can t submit this rating without giving it one star,1
224,definitely not a course for a beginner very confusing the part with the javascript is a real horror for beginner and even challenging for some newly programmer,1
225,very poorly structured explanation and example were not very helpful should revamp the course content and video lecture specially the steganography part,1
226,honestly not a very well designed course i went through the video and test for week and and found that it s just rushing u through the basic while not really telling u much much of it wa here s an introduction to a tiny detail you go find out the rest,1
227,the course doe not ha lecture slide that is better for student to understand,1
228,this course is really bad the instruction is not enough to solve the programming assignment the almost content aren t related to communicating data science result,1
229,this course is not maintained it s flat out exploitative to throw student at an aws assignment without updated instruction and with outdated version of pig script etc they re setting student up to hemorrhage money on aws and possibly not get anything out of it under no circumstance should you take this course or even this specialization so long a this assignment is gating it,1
230,much of the assignment wa out of date the content wa not related to big portion of the assignment there wa no way of getting clarification over the outdated assignment content,1
231,the lecture are excellent but do not take this course if you are not already proficient in a graphing package whether it s r python or something else much more sophisticated than excel otherwise you will be faced with the painfully frustrating task of learning a package while trying to complete an assignment all with a short deadline,1
232,i ve done quite a few online course over the past few year and i consider this is without doubt the poorest the lecture do not comprehensively provide the information needed to complete the assignment i think this is not just my opinion either a post in the course forum suggest other participant have the same view the stated module completion time are wildly optimistic i only managed to complete the course by substantial independent research consequently i would not recommend this course,1
233,the obstacle of not knowing french is quite detrimental,1
234,i do not like the different language i do not read fast enough to keep up and understand what is bing said i think we should have a language button to translate to english or any other language that take cources from corsera,1
235,decent course content but fairly basic however the peer graded evaluation are subjective and take too long to get feedback and progress in coursework i will not be taking another course that us this loose of a peer evaluation,1
236,instruction for assignment are not clear lecture are good but it practically impossible to get the certificate,1
237,hello i ve completed module of the specialization successfully with excellent grade however the biggest challenge and disappointment wa the capstone the case given is pertaining exclusively to the north american market student enrolling into the course are situated globally which make it extremely challenging to gather data to understand and substantiate our work on the project several hour of extensive research yield no usable data which could provide a logical direction to the project reading material provided explains mainly the company profile a few link are blocked due to geographical restriction report that are available are to be purchased etc while the money invested is not refundable now however coursera with university team need to seriously resolve this point all learning done through the course remains largely a theoretical knowledge if a student isn t able to apply it in his her job,1
238,there is no doubt that coursera platform is the best education in the worldbut i want to learn digital marketing and this capstone need to experience in the digital marketing not le than yearsi wish there are a path or template to work and learn such a the capstone project of specialization in marketing social mediathere is lack of information and data and the previous five course is insufficient for professional project like this capstonethe first course marketing in the digital world wa really the best course in courseraand this course is really the worst course in courseraand unhelpful and i did not learn anything from this course only gather information from various source to pas assignment,1
239,unfortunately a often happens what is simple and basic for one is not that for another this course presumes a comfortableness with coding that i simply do not posse a a teacher of high school science please try and develop a true introductory course that normal non programmer can access thanks,1
240,sadly i found the presentation poor not at all fluent and under prepared sometimes what wa said wa different from what wa written which wa correct potentially causing confusion also some result were given without justifying them for instance the concept of simplest number wa stated but not proper,1
241,i do not recommend this course if you want to be taught intuitively the slide are mostly just a list of bullet point with very few intuitive figure or chart normally figure chart are easier to understand and remember even the simple one you are just fed with lot of concept throughout the course but in the end you are suddenly required to do some practical c programming in contiki an embedded o which you need to spend some time to figure out quite a number of practical issue just for a successful run,1
242,i categorize this course in the beginner level not intermediate,1
243,useless bla bla bla in general word nothing concrete it is not possible to build embedded system with o after finishing it iot is mentioned just for marketing and promotion if you seriously consider developing o based embedded system even just reading wiki page about eos would not be such a waste of time a listening to this course,1
244,i am very disappointed in this specilization course i am working a a business analyst in a data warehouse consulting firm so i wa highly motivated to take all the course however lecturer s poor delivery ha taked me aback it is really hard to grasp the information when it ha simply been read to you the lecturer is always reading and it make me sick sorry anyway i would not continue with the course if nothing changed in my opinion if the lecturer respect student and his field of study he doe not read from the script and lack motivation,1
245,really not good i am trying to find out how to un enroll,1
246,i m unimpressed with the quality of the material and uninspired by the professor s video presentation out of the dozen or more course here that i have taken this one rank at the bottom i m not going to disenroll at this time but i have lost interest without even progressing beyond the first week maybe if i get inspired later i will try again,1
247,the tutorial are outdated i could not install all the software needed to complete the course nor do i understand what they are used for too bad look like a great course,1
248,too long not enough concrete material too much focused on u,1
249,not much teaching going on here the concept are barely touched on before the student is asked to jump into training exercise that require lengthy proof of concept not thoroughly taught,1
250,if i can understand all of these derivative why shall i attend your course it is not helpful course especially for person looking for some practical econometrics application rather than focusing on the mathematics side of it,1
251,the course is very short and more advanced course are not free,1
252,presentation is so boring and dry i could not bring myself to watching past the first couple of video,1
253,few content bad quality many mistake in the material no programming assignment poor support definitely not worth the money,1
254,there is no real flow between video and question not easy to follow good efford good content just wrong methodology for online training for,1
255,very basic for novice not worth it to pay money for it,1
256,when it come down to it there s simply not the support to assist a student that ha a really hard problem hacker mentality seems to equate to figure it out on your own cuz nobody s going to help you if thing do not work perfectly for you then you are likely never to be able to finish because your peer don t know any better either the way this class is set up make me angry every time i have to deal with it i would probably be just a well served doing just the swirl exercise i would quit if i hadn t paid all the way through in advance i can t believe this is the type of school john hopkins is to produce a course of this quality but i guess i have to,1
257,very dissapointing to not be able to make the quiz and the assigments without paying it,1
258,for such a terrible course to then change payment term without my authorisation take from my account without telling me clearly amongst all the other junk mail coursera have a lot to answer for and this specialisation is not even worth wasting your time if it wa free taught without purpose meaningless instruction given to copy without regard of the bigger picture,1
259,lecture and other material just don t cover the information needed in the course project majority of the learning ha to be done outside of this course in order to pas the course project i can not recommend this course anyone who is not deeply familiar with the topic already the course project is truly frustrating,1
260,description of assignment question is not clear the expected answer from the question are confusing,1
261,the theory explained and the exercise are not at the same level,1
262,total disappointment this wa only clipping through a tool not a real capstone project,1
263,very bad way of teaching and not reach content,1
264,superficial and not well presented,1
265,this course and material doe not articulate the google cloud platform offering maybe google doe not want to compete with microsoft azure and aws alike if google itself ha approved this google cloud platform training on coursera then vola i am out i am way better off supporting aws and azure at least they have ton of good training and stuff to keep folk in the field excited,1
266,the lab in this course have fundamental flaw which mean they can not be completed this is a major failing in a paid course such a this,1
267,the only option i had wa to watch video i could not submit quiz which i completed unless i paid what s even the point of having this course a part of coursera very disappointed shame on the university of maryland college park will stay away from this school,1
268,this course should really be called basic of healthy cooking or for people with unhealthy habit it is very basic and very based on the u reality living in europe and used to cooking healthy food for my family everyday i have not learned anything new very disappointing to see such a basic course being offered by big name a stanford university,1
269,well this course definetely ha a clear message and a good purpose however it is very basic and coursera might not the right platform,1
270,utterly disappointing i hoped for a fact based education on current scientific thinking in nutrition instead this course consists of a couple of people s opinion on eating without cited evidence presented in a feel good documentary lite format with good camerawork and cute child this is a high school public service announcement not a university course not what i d expect from stanford or coursera,1
271,this is not a course this is a minute lecture the idea is greate but this lecture is only start it very brief and not profound this more advice and not scientifically oriented,1
272,hi i wa looking for a good introduction course to food and nutrition and ala this is not it i knew of the thing discussed in this course and i wa expecting more but all i got wa very basic advice eat le don t eat crap etc all with videoclips and music which got annoying really quick disappointing take care,1
273,most of the information in this course is common sense it may be relevant for someone with very limited knowledge about food but for anyone who is moderately informed and interested in food there is not much to learn here,1
274,the final assignment is impossible to finish since i have version in my computer you a the course provider should modify the assignment instead of asking the student to make change the point is that we are trying to gain some knowledge not wasting time on solving those bug,1
275,this course is extremely hard to follow not because of the content but because of the delivery presentation visuals word choice speed all very poor i m in week and every video ha been just a difficult to follow quiz are hard to understand and ask you about thing that weren t of any actual value to the course and or weren t even covered also because multiple answer are required for each question you are basically answering a part question that is only worth point get one part wrong and you miss the whole point,1
276,poorly organized course the lecture seemed to jump around from one point to another in some case way too much detail in others not nearly enough the subtitle have so many error that they are virtually useless,1
277,difficult to understand due to her very strong accent and poor audio meaning i spend of my effort trying to make out what she s saying a it turn out all she doe is read from the slide no additional insight nothing this make it boring to hear and she come across with no personality although a quick rate my professor search tell u a very different story a real shame since people seem to really like her at any rate after one week of this course and not seeing any improvement i ve decided to call it quits,1
278,only catered to the american healthcare system this course wa not mind numbingly boring a hell,1
279,lecturer is very monotone and isn t engaging course also focus a lot on the history when it would be more relevant to look to the future it is peer graded which is extremely unreasonable people do not read the submission fully or fully have the knowledge to be able to grade someone else s work people also have different standard which cause a large variation in grade grading rubric doe not include area for where extra research ha been done either,1
280,it wa not a great course i found it not very rewarding because the discussion were hard to follow also it did not present historical literature and research on the subject i wa hoping for peer reviewed article and reading that helped illuminate the history and the psychology of education,1
281,from the start it seemed politically correct and ideological did not even broach the topic until the final week a far a i can see from the list of video life is too short,1
282,it s terrible if one want to accomplish the quiz using garud iyengar s note example in his note were not well explained,1
283,i think the way it is taught is not very insightful the lecturer clearly just read a script and make it difficult to follow they assignment question are often hard to understand most importantly there is very little about the actual mechanism behind pricing financial instrument instead they just state the formula,1
284,it is not a recommended course when they explain something they assume that we are expert and we know all what they are talking about they need to have statistic expert which is not mentioned in course prerequisite i recommend to review the material and to review the purpose of this course,1
285,it is a little sad that the material taught were not matching test material well in the quiz,1
286,what a shame english subtitle were promised and not arranged i truly wanted to learn this course obviously coursera doesn t care,1
287,peer reviewed assignment not a well planned marking system grade can be to vary dependent on fellow student for pas not most ideal,1
288,the reason why i am giving only one star that the course did not covered much information and the time allotted could have been le than week so it wa not really worth the money,1
289,not adapted to an online format low quality video interesting topic but no efficient progression many section become an update about ucsd research not adapted to the audience,1
290,have to say this course is not useful,1
291,this course doe not live up to the high value that i ve come to enjoy and expect at coursera the video are read by the teacher so the inflection are wrong making it very hard to follow the video are clipped short and cut off the word at the end the information is given so quickly with term not explained that a novice will likely not understand part of it i found no value here there are far better tutorial on the web i can t see how any college or university would respect any certificate from this course,1
292,the course is very disappointing and useless the two lecturer are not explaining anything properly they are just showing slide and handing out link the only useful part of the course is module which is outside the scope of the course and taught by guest lecturer i would not spend time on this course and instead find another source for learning wordpress,1
293,if you have any experience with website this course is not for you it is merely about the soft stuff got a couple of nice link to color scheme generator et cetera but did not deliver what i thought it promised,1
294,the sequence of the learning movie are not good and some time while teaching the the movie is ended besides rather than educational material this course refer to several website,1
295,i thought you would learn how to actually create a website not just how to pick and install a premade wordpress theme,1
296,despite all the bad review this course got i told myself to give it a try to refresh my antic prior knowledge and since it is for my personal usage and not a career i m not interested in a certificate so i went through all the open site which were extremely disappointing since i wa warned by the review i wa not even tempted to pay to unlock further page i attended many interesting course on coursera but this one is simply a waste of time from the very first moment,1
297,if i could give this course a lower score i would it wa not helpful at all i ended up having to take another course so i could actually complete my website,1
298,this is a bait and switch you must purchase the course even though part are free it s really not,1
299,this course should be called intro to fundamental of website design you may learn in the process of a few day how to create a website but not how to create a website in a weekend,1
300,feel like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful when designing character for video game is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn t place any emphasis into it so for the price the charge in the certificate it really feel like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful at all other school like gnomon workshop and dvd like eat d and many others out there which give e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here it need to be deeper and more robust if this course want to stand out right now is not,1
301,very poor presentation and content difficult to navigate and all the link used including that for galaxy are outdated there wa no effort made to provide a method to get through the course given all the change since the video were recorded this course is the reason i have decided not to pursue the specialization it fall under,1
302,the material information required for the capstone wa not covered in the lecture and required considerable additional time and effort to find via online forum and the galaxy page themselves a manual of code example and type of job would have been great further a better use of time would be to start doing the capstone on day and do all of the lecture and quiz later a the quiz were very easy and anecdotal but the capstone required more time then scheduled in the course,1
303,course assignment requires knowledge that is not discussed in the course various inconsistency throughout the course week s material is not really helpful and i had a feeling that the instructior just wanted to wrap up the course and didn t really care if the material is appropriate poorly written quiz,1
304,this course did not make any effort until i had to dig deep into biology by myself the course content is insufficient i think if a sample input wa used and every field of the input were explained and also the output were explained then it would make much more sense poorly designed and demonstrated thankfully i started the last assignment very quickly it took me day to understand how to proceed with the assignment the ta is excellent without his help i wouldn t pas this course,1
305,this course s content is useful but honestly the final project is ridiculous because it is peer reviewed and the project is not very straightforward everyone get different answer and without an answer key no one know what is right and wrong making it is almost impossible to pas this need to change,1
306,this course wa very disappointing and much of the content in the test and course did not show up in the course project i felt like the course project wa far more advanced than all the other detail in addition there wa minimal to no detail on instruction very poor development here and i would not recommend it to anyone all you need to do is look at all the thread of complaint i am looking forward to the next python course and h,1
307,it give a quick background on galaxy and it software content is appropriate but doe not prepare you for even the final assignment or real genomic problem,1
308,quite confused during the majority of this course especially after how clear the first course wa wa able to follow instruction but did not fully understand why i wa doing anything not enough foundation given the final project came out of no where we did not learn nearly enough in the course to be able to tackle that the majority of step that needed to be taken were not taught in class or if they were they were glossed over i wa floored by how the class went form simple to extremely complicated with no transition phase,1
309,awful just awful there are dozen of student trying to install pentaho and failing only reason i managed is that i have prior experience with the software there are no ta no help nothing the quiz is a scam designed to force you to shell out even more money of the so called optional textbook and the assignment are extremely vague and order of magnitude beyond the laughable minute the instructor suggested they should take my submission for week total over page and i work a full time job avoid this class do not reward terrible course with your cash,1
310,the quiz feedback are empty this is not good,1
311,hard to follow idea are not organized and are not well presented lecturer ha many pause that even on increased playback speed x are still distracting do not recommend,1
312,that person should not teach nobody the person is not able to construct a sentence without denial and course ha really little information but lot of empty talking,1
313,not very informative content some part are interesting but not worth the money the worst thing is all assignment are writting work that are evaluated by colleague meaning it is purely objective to the extent that one question asks if my uploaded file is in a readable format example pdf txt etc and two out of three marking my pdf file a not and not even leaving a comment why they are giving that bad score on obvious thing,1
314,you can not even complete the first quiz before they demand your p,1
315,followed instruction to download twice waste of time both time still kept getting an error never got past this to continue with the course so didn t learn anything other than there is little support out there to resolve the problem i think because the course is not monitored or if it is well then more fool me it would have been a good opportunity to explore this had it been possible to download unity oh well those who can do those who can t resume their day to day life packing box,1
316,this course and material doe not articulate the google cloud platform offering maybe google doe not want to compete with microsoft azure and aws alike if google itself ha approved this google cloud platform training on coursera then vola i am out i am way better off supporting aws and azure at least they have ton of good training and stuff to keep folk in the field excited,1
317,i didnt like this course i found it to be confusing compared to other cs j html course such a the one from michigan or hong kong university which are quite clear and crispt and refreshing this seems like a work in progress confusing convoluted odd html cs j are actually not very difficult this course make u question your own name make you think basic math is calculus it need work lot and lot of work i cant recommend it to anyone who is serious about learning j html or cs it accomplishes the exact opposite with regard to that chinese restaurant field trip what the hell man is this a joke have the lady call web com and have a cookie cutter just add water web site this segment is silly the rest of the segment confusing,1
318,this course wa extremely time consuming because a great deal of effort wa required to translate it into something i could use i had a great deal of trouble with following the lecture video the demonstration of the tool were typed on a screen that wa too small and the command line tool were executed so quickly that it s hard to see where the screen full of data came from the lecturer had such poor pronunciation that lecture transcript show that the voice recognition software could not understand and transcribe a lot of her word for example command sounded like comment and likewise wa transcribed that way more seriously it wa hard to hear the difference between vcf and bcf,1
319,this is the worst course i ve ever listened and i ve listened my fair share of online course do this course only if you want to complete whole specialization professor is simply awful english is not her native language obviously but even that is not the problem she simply speaks sentence that doesn t make sense at all and she obviously doesn t have computer science background if she doe then she is even worse then i thought,1
320,did not learn anything useful at all,1
321,i would not recommend this one to any paying customer this is the second intro to graphic design class i have take on coursera and i found the way the material wa presented in the calarts course to be quite slow and pretty boring our assignment were simple and i felt no excitement in doing them it would have been beneficial to see how these fundamental building block could be used in real life design the other class by cu boulder made me want to continue learning and i felt excited to complete the project whereas with this class i wa forcing myself to sit down to finish just the required one,1
322,i hate to say it but this course is really really bad not practical at all i m not sure where this is all going maybe by the fourth course in the series hour later of lecture you might have something practical but this approach feel wrong i m sorry it s a reputable school and who the hell am i but one man s opinion rethink how you go about introducing the newbie to graphic design a it s applicable to the real world,1
323,i wa led to believe that i would be learning the fundamental of graphic design which to me mean learning how to use photoshop indesign etc this is more about learning how to create art in general not exactly what i m looking for,1
324,this course is based on personal anecdote and not fact many of the example provided have been proven to be farce and or practical joke,1
325,too much peer and dealing with others not making me happy at all,1
326,what make this course useful are the exercise so unless you are paying don t bother and it s not really worth paying for a it s just a synopsis of stuff you easily find on youtube,1
327,no star okay this class is very pointless it is super boring and give me little information he say that you do not need to buy his book or visit his suggested website however that is all he talk about at least the test are not focused on that it mostly on vague point he explains i would not recommend this class,1
328,i wa really disappointed in this course for several reason i did not complete it because it wa really not worth spending time on the organizer impressed me a only wanting to sell copy of his book on dog behavior and used the course a his vehicle then there were game to purchase online to facilitate teaching my dog cognitive skill the video were lacking in creativity i wa really disappointed with this especially since it a cool topic that could easily be presented in a very exciting way the artistic level the video slide etc were something a high school student could pull together after taking solid course like modpo and positive psychology i wa amazed at the lack of effort that wa put into this,1
329,i have fallen asleep during th week and it have never happened to my during any of the coursera course i m sorry but it completely failed my expectation week out of gone and i have learnt absolutely nothing about dog yes i got some psychological basis but that s not what i looked for the lecturer politely suggests to buy his book well if it is the same quality a the presented course than it s useless,1
330,i just do not feel a connection with this professor he is constantly plugging his book and the website the content is just not engaging,1
331,a waste of money only but it wa so terrible i did not even want to finish it and apparently i waited too long to get a refund a well never again,1
332,this is basically just one giant commercial for the web site a whole lot of talk but not a lot of information i wa going to finish the course anyway to pick up what is in there but i just can not stand any more plug very disappointed,1
333,the video lecture are not adequate too much self study effort is needed to have a good understanding of the subject the time allocated for this topic is not enough,1
334,the course is very light on substance there are significantly better course and book available on the same subject matter i definitely would not recommend this course,1
335,course ha not been updated wrong answer in quiz eg week quiz on progressivity video getting blocked at review question point etc i am checking out,1
336,course could have earn my star money money money is not the way to go,1
337,although the course wa very useful i couldn t complete the course due to an assignment the assignment is very unrealistic and the grader don t give any feedback the assignment is open ended question and not difficult but took significant time when i submit i wa unable to pas,1
338,i don t know what is the problem a i study the video well and when it come to taking quiz i never pas so i watch the video over and aver again but it always the same resultthe part of other language i m not sure what is the point of it i mean doe it help in english to know how to say for example hi in other language plz if anyone passed the course could u plz help me,1
339,this course is not so good a lot of thing are just come from the instructor s head without correcting reference from high quality literature he can say whatever he think is right but i would not say all animal do not have complex language system or we have one single origin of language i would also suggest the instructor to interview more world famous linguist not just play simple ask and answer with his student the example of different language in the later week are interesting but somehow i expect some better understanding of more aspect of language in general i would say it still ha so much space for improvement i would not recommend anyone to spend time on learning this course,1
340,i do not like this course there are far too many prejudicial idea even in the first unit a language doe not have to be used by a single unified group to define it a a language esperanto is a perfectly valid language fully capable of expression and doe not belong to a single unified group there are no native speaker either which doe not rob it of the fact that there are winner of the nobel prize for literature who write in it the thing you are saying about language are not merely willfully ignorant they are highly offensive prejudicial i can not conscience supporting a course like this,1
341,the material is not mature yet some thing were not tested by the teacher before being part of the course and do not actually work question asked on the forum about it got no answer before the end of the course,1
342,very u centered and assignment not well connected to the lecture,1
343,a lot of theoretical stuff nothing for practice awful final exam strategy the course encourages learning by heart without any thinking advice to help non english student like me make the lecture not overlapping the subtitle,1
344,poorly executed lost my interest very quickly i thought that this course wa going to be a enjoyable a dr chuck s python for everyone given that both instructor are from the same institution and both course belong to similarly named specialization that is for everyone but i ended up disappointed my suggestion for the instructor redo your lecture slide or point out to all of the error in the slide it is not acceptable for you to just say that they contain error and not point out where all of the error in the slide are you only pointed out to one error in the slide by the way also i personally believe that it would have been much more interesting if you had not read off a screen for your lecture try speaking off the top of your head,1
345,it ok html is not code it a mark up language when she cant explain sheo cover it up with attitude word or skip quickly,1
346,the instructor might be a good web developer but neither she nor anyone else on her team know how to write a parser unfortunately that is exactly what they attempted to do for grading final project unless you are ready to suffer through several hour of tearing your hair out because their parser doe not accept perfectly written code don t take this course the only thing you ll learn through the experience is that some people should stay a far away from writing autograders a the planet would allow them additionally the information presented in this course is available in several better structured and presented version both on coursera and other mooc platform so you don t need this course in particular in order to learn the material,1
347,autograder will not accept my valid code that contains all valid element will not make the deadline so will not bother continuing,1
348,a an educator myself i found this class to be rather pathetic in it structure and the assignment these are topic and activity that i wa doing a a student in middle school and junior high both public school mind you not art centered charter charging people for a certificate in this class is tantamount to what diploma mill do a the course requirement are not up to even senior high school level coursework truly coursera what happened to your open education offering real education,1
349,a weaker version of fundamental of graphic design with way too much overlap it should not be included in the specialization,1
350,i personally did not find it constructive enough to spend money on it is way too general and basic i expected something more articulated and not so elementary,1
351,i thought this course would be more fun and interesting but i find it very repetitive with the fundamental of graphic design if you buy the package it kind of seems like i wasted dollar on a repetitive and monotone professor and course i would not recommend this course within the specialization,1
352,this course offer a lot of interesting topic but the way of their presentation is not very amazing so the student loses easily the concentration,1
353,quiz and assignment can not be submitted if course is audited,1
354,speaker is not energetic or something lacking make it boring,1
355,very short not good it doesnt give anything about entrepreneurship,1
356,i did not conclude the course because of the fundamentally wrong guidance that this lecturer promotes today we know more advanced and useful methodology for entrepreneurship,1
357,the most boring course i have ever done in my life soporific course content interesting but professor is just reading slide with reading mistake every word i would not recommend this course at all,1
358,poor presentation skill mostly reading slide unclear and inconsistent in what pre requisite knowledge is needed for the course in one place he assumes one doe not know digital logic but then later he assumes you know hardware language fpga design etc wa a waste of time shame on coursera that pre requisite knowledge wa removed from the site,1
359,very slow paced and boring the instructor is not good at teaching,1
360,amateurish presentation and there is some technical issue with the content the video get stuck a lot and the problem is not my internet,1
361,i should have never paid for this course by the time i got into the subject the refund policy wa expired do not take pay for this course or program at all,1
362,not very well organized,1
363,i think this course ha a lot of value but when i started these course i wa unaware i would need a few hundred more dollar and did not budget for such thing,1
364,the course started a month late when it finally started it wa boring i can believe i paid for the certificate despite paying for it i m not going to bother completing it,1
365,i wa looking for a course for a basic learner this is not i feel it very complicate and not friendly for a person with guitar skill,1
366,this course start off interesting and then just get absurd a huge chunk of the genetic part ha activity where you have to translate large genetic sequence by hand if you don t have access to a printer trying to break up genetic code into letter codon and translating them is an exercise in frustration plus the sequence are not even easily formatted for printing a they are all image so you can t even just copy them into an editor and break up the sequence this wa only the second course i dropped on cousera,1
367,very unclear in the way it wa presented and the subject that are being talked about and not very interesting partly because it wa to easy for me,1
368,half of the link to external reading and video did not work which is the reason i did not complete the course it made taking the quiz fairly impossible unless i wanted to spend my time googling the answer,1
369,i have completed two other coursera course for certificate where i learned much more the quantity and quality of the content both video s and reading material is significantly lower than that of the other course where i really had to take note and read much more the assignment are way to general and do not require much preparation which hardly make them serious learning exercise frankly i could have done some interview and research online and make a a course like this myself,1
370,i dislike the way the grade is settled because of the difficulty and technicality of the course passing grade should be out of instead of out of we are not phd s but student learner,1
371,the lecture were good but when it came to quiz and assignment we do not know what to do the question were very complicated and not stated in the lecture,1
372,this class setting is interesting you can not participate in assignment and quiz unless pay for certificate,1
373,it is not free they just sell the certificate there is not any free statement about accomplishment of the course so nobody will know that you have completed it in the future you have not got anything to show in your cv i want my statement of accomplishment,1
374,neo liberal and neo con presentation of the matter that ha little to do with how the real world work or should work had we had a fair play field would not expect anything else from the neo liberal flagman yale pretty much expected it would be the case but just wanted to give it a try,1
375,i am disappointed about this course i wa expecting to learn more in this subject a described on the course info however the quality of the lecture is not good at all i haven t found any lecture that present the knowledge a the ivy league university a yale i felt sorry for the student who actually attained this class at yale campus the professor wa not prepare for the lecture and confused forgot sometime i wa hoping that the nobel prize winner would teach something that complicated in the simple way the question in the exam ask mostly about year person number which is not the good exam per my perspective if you want the have the certificate from yale you can take this course but if you want to learn about financial market i would not recommend this course i m so sorry,1
376,very scattered and long lesson very difficult to learn something that is not textual examination is based on literal term e g what year wa xx reform enacted not the type of knowledge i thought i would get,1
377,the wieos are not targeting online student the video are long but not teaching many thing the course is too gneral,1
378,boring most of them are history don t worth it week into the course very boring not technical enough the test basically asked people to remember thing that are not useful,1
379,a page reading could have make it not enough material to be consider a course,1
380,story telling module not really useful for iot purpose,1
381,the presenter are very annoying and i did not learn anything from this,1
382,big part of the course video devoted to history of how the technology wa developed not much technical information about the technology itself,1
383,i m pretty much always turned off when a course won t let those who are auditing the course i e not paying take the assessment i m dropping out,1
384,did not email when graded and had to email for everything to be fixed example project were not similar at all to actual project and relied heavily on search engine to figure out what wa asked of me,1
385,this class doe not go in depth enough for debutant people to figure out how to do the assessment or gain a good understanding of what is covered,1
386,the course and specialization look promising but i get the feeling that the instructor have been a little lazy while designing the assignment instead of auto grading using well known testing framework like other coursera course the entire grading policy is based on review from fellow student which make your grade subjective secondly since the number of mandatory required review for each student is fixed at and is not adjusted with the number of student it is highly unlikely that all submission will be reviewed or graded,1
387,i think it s useless spending that amount of time explaining this basic it is not worth it i d rather go deeper in angularjs nodejs or ionic after all this is a course for a mid level so you should go to another course to take the basic and here a more advanced level,1
388,i do not see review by teacher i had biggest expectatives very disappointed some reviewer don t see beyond the format the system ha glitch still appear message that were reviewed and sent,1
389,this class the fourth in the specialization required a different version of unity d in order to complete compared to the first course in the specialization using a borrowed laptop i wa not permitted to upgrade to a new version by laptop owner signing up for the course specialization and paying in advance wa a ripoff since the software requirement changed in between course and coursera give no refund for a course specialization if you have completed the first course,1
390,no use for me no music example because copyright did not allow so the course is pretty boring sorry not for me,1
391,this course and material doe not articulate the google cloud platform offering maybe google doe not want to compete with microsoft azure and aws alike if google itself ha approved this google cloud platform training on coursera then vola i am out i am way better off supporting aws and azure at least they have ton of good training and stuff to keep folk in the field excited,1
392,very very bad communication from the teacher the nd mooc wa supposed to start i think month ago it did not start at the time of this review they did not even bother to post some announcement to let the student know ok course start in x month making thing worse you can not get a refund if you purchased the entire thing,1
393,first time i gave star reason lecturer are terrible this deserves a report if there wa adequate reporting system on coursera i had a feeling like i wa watching professor from school for disabled and not an university course material is actually decent but extremely badly presented sadly i enrolled into second course a well and hoping that one will be better so i wont have to go through refund hell,1
394,it is told that to take this course basic computer skill like sending email and downloading file are necessary this is a beginning level course then in the first module instructor talk about polymorphism inheritance and abstraction for someone who have no prior programming experience these are definitely not suitable topic to start with moreover student are supposed to learn these concept to get a good grade from first quiz although they know nothing about programming i had some programming experience so i wa already familiar with these subject but the lecture were too boring to keep watching i watched like video and learned nothing about the course subject i think i won t be spending my time for this course which seems to me like reading some reference file,1
395,basing on the first video i would not recommend this course to anyone believing that you are expected have basic computer literacy skill such a knowing how to send receive email and browse the web the lector is robotic the slide look outdated listener is bored after min of watching i definitely would not pay for this course i will change the rate after i watch more video but this course is a big no no for me,1
396,the course doesn t allow access to the quiz unless you pay for it i consider this to be contradictory with the statement that the free version of the course give you access to all the material also not being able to take the quiz make the course meaningless,1
397,this course and material doe not articulate the google cloud platform offering maybe google doe not want to compete with microsoft azure and aws alike if google itself ha approved this google cloud platform training on coursera then vola i am out i am way better off supporting aws and azure at least they have ton of good training and stuff to keep folk in the field excited,1
398,the entire course lack a flow it look like concept that are taught are picked at random and stuffed into the course the quiz really do not complement the material taught the instructor want the student to focus on specific wording of his lecture rather than the concept in order to pas the quiz,1
399,do not take this course the guy who read not teach the course justin nicholas toytama is horrendous he s too lazy to even type out the code and ha the world s most monotonous voice he pause often to read this note and ha enthusiasm teaching this class if this class is not part of the certificate specialization i wouldn t even pay for this course get you further with nick walter or rob percival s udemy course,1
400,instructor voice is too low and intro music is too high video quality is bad course content is for very beginner people beginner to programming not only to swift sorry to say it but this course is really bad doe not deserve to be in this specialization,1
401,actually i am quite disappointed by this course the language is so slow that it is terribly difficult to make sense of each sentence the content barely scratch the surface and there is neither a forum nor an exchange with other learner i miss interactivity and i am glad that i decided to preview the course and not pay for it a it definitely is not worth the money,1
402,i felt that the delivery wa not effective the pacing and tone of the speech wa challenging for me to listen to there were unnatural pause within sentence causing the lecture to drag out longer than necessary and it wa difficult to connect the thought of a sentence together because of the unnatural pause the result of this wa that it it required an inordinate amount of effort to understand each sentence and to put together the sentence into meaning,1
403,it s a week course that s not particularly difficult or creative with the assessment,1
404,the content is interesting but the presentation can be improved so that audience will not fall asleep easily,1
405,completely not what i ve expected too theoretical without example and explanation,1
406,the professor just read the slide and most of the slide and content are repetitive the content of the entire course can be studied in le than hour so did the other course of this specialization it s not a good course and i think it s not worth to purchase these class,1
407,video are poorly edited too much blank space the bullet point are not clearly visible there is no narrative or discursive structure the diagram are not clear and the interview are raw and unedited session are too long and include too much irrelevant information the little useful information there is is not structured clearly and thus it s harder to learn the material for the first week resemble more to someone talking about the good ol day rather than a properly thought out history class i had to leave the course a i found it to be a waste of my time and i am glad i decided not to pay for a certificate for it my expectation were a lot higher for a university course,1
408,perhaps it s just that i m not a part of the target audience of this course but i am deeply dissatisfied with it aside from a couple of rare interview and old video record which admittedly were very interesting though too few i found nothing of value that can not be learned by reading wikipedia or other easily accessible source the course is pretty light on technical detail and there could and perhaps should have been much more beyond the scene content a well a reference to specific document and event in order to justify this course s existence in other word if you are a techie and are indeed interested in this topic chance are that you already know most of the material taught,1
409,while the content is very helpful and gary doe his best to make people confident to improvise in jazz music this course ha imho two major flaw the biggest one assignment given and result accepted do not fit together e g in week learner are supposed to describe in their own word how a piece of music doe sound like but the accepted answer are totally different from such a description instead only a very detailed and specialized answer is accepted this lead to studends copying these answer into their assignment without them learning anything the other flaw is that gary is very brief in his explanation even intermediate musician seem to struggle with content just because some explanation are not exact or vague,1
410,instructor is clearly reading off of card or a prompter that doesn t face the camera so he s constantly not looking at you which is frustrating the feeling of each lesson being so scripted take away from the feeling of a professor teaching material with which he is comfortable comparing this to uc san diego course video is like night and day and really make you realize the importance of quality production natural flow of teaching,1
411,any course that requires a webcam is not serious what a bunch of ridiculous crap is this for adult trying to learn or teenage girl trying to chat,1
412,not a good course,1
413,very interesting but i wa really hoping more for example the professor doe not teah u directly like all the other course on coursera it is only text and archive video youtube would have done the same disappointed,1
414,it s not on architecture for iot a name suggests it s general software architecture course,1
415,quite useless i didnt feel that i learned anything at all assingments seem to be dessinged by someone very lazy the limitation of the assingments do not allow the student to practice what it been tought but it is asked in the peer assingment from the student to evaluate it i understand that when calling it introduction it is supposed to be aimed for people totally starting from but still i cant see how this course is of any use it is short and doe not cover anything i am very surpirsed that getting the certificate for this course cost the same in than getting the certificate of the introduction to principle of game design principle of game design ha more than double hour of class and in the assingments you actually create a game and practice new stuff this course wa very dissappointing,1
416,for someone who is not familiar with inferential statistic this course is too compact i lost the overall picture it seems that a dozend method were introduced but i failed to understand under which precondition each method is deployable i am confused,1
417,the content is too rich and the explanation is too little the no feedback exam is misleading difficult to pas the course staff is not that helpful,1
418,use of duke own specialised librarie not the best way of learning progamming for the real world,1
419,poorly designed and explained you do not really gain much knowledge from this course i would not recommend my friend and basically others to take this course there are far better course out there for much cheaper price,1
420,if you are a real beginner like me having zero or little programming knowledge and your time is limited i think this course or the specialisation is not suitable for you the assignment and quiz are very time consuming one week i spent literally hour writing and debugging code for just one quiz,1
421,this course is not suitable for beginner at all everything basic is skipped highly not recommended,1
422,the course is too boring i am not sure if it is because of the language or the lecture,1
423,use very specific environment that can not be used in practice in the the real world for a much better course use uc san diego version,1
424,they push the university of maryland way too much the book and the video have much of the same content the book that you buy is written by the professor who run the course which i do not agree with the book could be more direct in how it give you the lesson,1
425,do not take this course unless you have previous c coding experience it is most definitely not for beginner,1
426,video were not ellaborative example sparse and were not edited to completion after month of this course repeatedly being delayed we see a complete failure with information design both in course and in practice i wa very dissapointed with this course and the time wasting assignment i have enjoyed the course leading up to this one but this course wa obviously rushed and poorly planned,1
427,a very simplistic and chaotic course explanation are all over the place bluej is probably the worst ide i have ever seen and i have been a programmer for about year there are far better course i would not recommend this course at all,1
428,this course wa required by my director but it is not for those who have no background in law which wa the case for the group of u at cdc who were required to take this it wa very difficult to iuinderstand and i did not think it wa a beginner s course for no,1
429,i ve just wasted hour going through repetition of what i ll learn but not actually learning anything why is it called free if i can t submit answer to quiz unless i upgrade first i now have an adverse reaction towards that course that it doesn t really have much content to it and i m not the least eager to upgrade thank you very much,1
430,not very dynamic,1
431,i really did not understand this course there wa way too much jargon,1
432,the course are fantastic but month hard working to earn a cheap certificate that look false i can not present it to my company,1
433,very bad because you need person to evaluate you every week and often this person is not educated or give a score zero for all so having to re course or leaving without convincing reason,1
434,i am giving star to this mooc because giving is not an option the savoir relier protocol might be efficient when taught face to face in a classroom but a a mooc it is a massive waste of time and money i paid for the capstone project and i m feeling robbed i learnt absolutely nothing this mooc is a major disappointment from a school such a hec,1
435,all assignment giving you more insight on your personality had to be purchased i did not really feel like a free course too,1
436,i just started the course and i m going to stop this course right away in my opinion showing hitler a an appropriate leader is not the course i want to visit i do not upport any racist mindset,1
437,to be honest there are no technique here that can not be found in many other place the only difference is that they explain the science behind the technique which in term of practical application is not very useful at all,1
438,video aren t of good quality and the tool aren t concrete enough to be useful there is not enough material i hope they will improve it because the subject is interesting,1
439,this course did not motivate me at all video where mainly repetitive and the question seemed to be there to serve no purpose,1
440,practical tip are few and neuroscience is not the title of the course but is widely discussed the title implies tool for learning but i didn t get anything useful out of this course,1
441,i am very disapointed about this course this course is more about how programming then teaching about programming in python the lecture is too long and information value is very low in my opinion this course is for somebody who never programming it is not depend in which language if you wont to know how if for function work what is variable etc then this is the right place where to learn this basic,1
442,not upto the mark not meant for intelligent student,1
443,huge waste of time they will give you very little information and what is expected for you to be able to do with that information is astronomical you will never learn any of the detail of how computing work how function work the mechanism behind these computation or anything to give you an example you will first watch a horribly made video on boolean logic alter going to youtube to get a better explanation of and or and not you ll see an example done with if else and elif then be asked to do homework problem using and or not this huge gap between the information given and the information you are expected to know to solve the problem they give you is too large i found differential equation easier than this,1
444,just some basic knowledge most of the knowledge is not expanded or deep introduced,1
445,the given introduction didn t help me to figure out how the grading system will look like there are no assignment to submit only online group work which is not organised well at all there are too many thread and the it s not at all clear what to write about apparently i should write about certain case but i couldn t find the content of the case there is no proper introduction work overview or anything very dissapointing,1
446,i am very disappointed with this course i had to wait too long on grading first time i got not naff point then i had to wait for about few month on grading i will not take capstone for this course because i suppose i would wait about a few year on grading this course ha to change grading process because ha no adequate number of student for peer review,1
447,the course is acceptable however it should be called introduction to voip communication or developing voip application rather than it current title assignment are either super easy or never have a right answerpersonally i will not recommend this course for other who want to understand iot,1
448,i m dropping out of a specialisation i paid for because the quality of the material is really low and the presentation is very similar i don t want to discourage the presenter but this is not the level i expected,1
449,it look like a youtube review and not a real course,1
450,too fast paced not suited for absolute beginner first week take alone about week to complete and master,1
451,a course graded only by your peer what s the point well the peer that graded my answer are not qualified to grade my work useless wast of time grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,1
452,would not let me leave course after signing up due to family issue i could not continue but due to some weird policy after purchasing this class i could not drop still can t,1
453,the irony of the fact that a course that wa meant to teach how to appropriate evaluate adult learner wa full of quiz that were riddled with guess what i m thinking short answer question and multiple choice question with or correct answer wa not lost on me i ended up leaving the course during week three after issue with a quiz that wa described in the forum a impossible it s too bad the course description wa very promising,1
454,did not like the course at all that is why i decided to discontinue the course,1
455,not too good because in assignment session they doesnt know what the right an is a in first assignment the ques is about circumference of circle a in google the exact an is what they wronged it,1
456,this requires a high level understanding of math highest high school level especially si and exponent it is not suitable for people with no background in math or physic,1
457,this is a very old fashion way of looking at development and developer where developer are considered resource and minion that need to follow order modern development technique value developer and allow them to be much more active player product manager is not a manager but a facilitator this course describes the view that developer are loose canon that need to be managed and that upfront planning and estimation are the right path i do not agree at all with this view should you happen to agree with this view the course is well explained and presented well,1
458,course title is misleading it is actually a course on managing agile software development not product management there is common understanding in active product management community that major focus for product manager is market market is not mentioned in this course at all what requirement and schedule guy current product management is all about hypothesis a b testing customer development experiment lean ux etc you completely missing the point still this course can be a good one for those who want to start managing agile software development,1
459,difference between a software project and a software product of course it is defined by convention but it is there and is pretty generally understood typical software project are bespoke application developed for the use of one organization and typically automates a business process a s w product on the other hand is built and sold to a range of user in the target group who can be individual to large organization this course doe not seem to address any of the issue faced by a s w product manager i think this course completely miss the point,1
460,i wa denied completion of this course because a fellow course taker felt the need to grade unfairly i suggest all peer keep in mind we are here to learn not to be judge so critically the spirit of the course wa destroyed by a thoughtless action if you wish to be critical that s fine but at least have the courage to leave feedback for me to review coward,1
461,the quality of the presentation is very low and way below the quality in other course the assignment are very poorly designed this is not a subjective personal experience this is based on discussion with other learner in the forum who have expressed disappointment and frustration,1
462,i wrote some indepth feedback but par for the course i can t save it either here or on the discussion board nothing obscene but certainly some major frustration with format inconsistency in scoring and format information not reviewed in the course on some of the quiz the fact that coursera keep trying to sell me the specialty the lack of any moderator on the discussion board to provide assistance and can go on with the technical issue to but i won t,1
463,you know when u see a bunch of good review of a restaurant and then go there and the food is terrible the place is awful and the waiter are the worst well same here class structure is messy communication skill are poor i know this is not a design course but the example shown in html are so bad u think u are watching a course from the teacher say frustrating some many time and us so much negative word towards coding and html maybe she hope not desencoraje student by empathy but end up doing the exact opposite i would not recommend this course not to newbie not to oldie not to anyone searching to have a good learning experience finishing this course wa painfull and i only did it because i promised myself not to abandond it,1
464,major issue with the test not accepting chinese or pinyin text which they failed to respond to despite multiple complaint,1
465,despite being someone with spoken mandarin ability i have decided to stop taking this course due to the new vocabulary not being explicitly described or explained in much detail the basic grammar is also skipped over in explanation,1
466,most of it you can t do unless you pay for it not sure i can even click complete for the course so not really a mooc no option for collaboration video had useful content about of the week resource wa by far the best and most useful,1
467,could not get to the fourth course and wa asked to pay for it twice,1
468,ended up not being able to take the rest of the course i paid for because coursera kept pushing it back start date after start date moved,1
469,horribly designed and developed jack wu may be an expert but he doe not know how to teach others,1
470,i feel robbed i did not get any feedback on my work only a classmate gave their ok yes there is something written i did not follow the course to get a certificate but to learn and to revceive feedback if you don t have a special purpose for the certificate don t pay a cent for this,1
471,poorly designed and explained you do not really gain much knowledge from this course i would not recommend my friend and basically others to take this course there are far better course out there for much cheaper price,1
472,i have met with nothing but frustration with this course though the lecture are understandable but the reading are comparable but unrelated to the material in the lecture i also had no kind of communication with instructor ta or other student for help it is ridiculous that there is no feedback forum and this seems to be the only course that handle it that way if this an institutional decision to not have feedback it seems that these instructor and or the university of california irvine do not care to help student i would not recommend this to anyone,1
473,the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe it wa very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issue with the course developer a lack of understanding of how coursera work it s clear they did not care to adapt to a week course and peer reviewed activity proposed that took over week to get done further to the course timeframe the assistance from developer wa too poor and never sought to find solution which is very strange in a course for coaching not the mention video quality that is scary i could not watch the video and preferred to study by reading the transcription,1
474,week doe not give enough explanation or extra resource and make it unable to complete the exercise,1
475,i would rename this course a programming octave with application to machine learning rather that machine learning once you start the course you will have to focus on octave rather than on ml topic if you want to do programming exercise there is no degree of freedom in programming you are provided with a lot of weird octave code which you will have to complete instead of writing yourself from scratch more than of my time wa spent in order to learn octave and understand guess octave code so if you really want to learn ml and try it in practice this course is not for you however you could just watch the video whose level is not more that elementary introduction to ml,1
476,professor didn t do a good job on explaining the theory he move too fast this should improve so that student who ha le weak knowledge of math can pas the quiz if you are not a math student don t take this class i wa hoping to learn about how to program to control the machine robot but it turn out that this is more focusing on the theory instead i would recommend to take another course of ml big data from uci instead,1
477,only theory no practice i don t need math at this point a i don t know even how to build simple machine learning program programming assignment come with no explanation it is not possible to finish this course without learning from other source on the web material attached to this course are not enough to understand the subject i have trouble understanding what the teacher is trying to teach from the very beginning of course,1
478,however good the material and lecture may be the use of an outdated version of octave which is not mac friendly and exceedingly brittle to the extent where the supplied code requires manual patching in window and linux is a complete turn off and make it nearly impossible to complete the assignment on time unless you re prepared to spend at least twice a much time debugging your setup a doing the actual assignment i ll come back when this is done with r or python,1
479,been asked to re take all assignment after paying for a certificate i wil never pay for a coursera course again and i would not recommend my friend to do so,1
480,the course is ok but the certification procedure is a mess no statement of accomplishment and you have to retake all the assignment if you want the certificate and had not been verified,1
481,i m not installing anything completely app cloud based or forget it need to do to the teaching of machine learning what aleks is doing to the teaching of mathematics,1
482,this class wa not useful for me the professor talked about the idea of data analysis without ever discussing how to actually perform data analysis,1
483,good course but not good from coursera to not give honor certificate like it used to give edx still give very disappointed with coursera,1
484,very disappointed in this course light on content and heavy especially in week on political bias towards one political persuasion highly biased and controversial statement by those in video are taken a fact without any attempt to question it i expected a course to talk about election and apply it to instead what is here is a course that not so subtly seems to have an agenda not good for academic discourse i believe this is my first negative review in my or so year on coursera,1
485,rather uninteresting presentation i found it hard to become interested in the course or kierkegaard after having high hope of truly enjoying it the best part of the lecture were when the instructor wa taped at venue pertinent to the course the peer reviewer were not always fair in my opinion i d spend my time elsewhere personally especially since this course wa something for my own personal edification and not a requirement,1
486,very low material not enough example full email,1
487,huge backlog of assignment from other session of the course that are waiting for peer review make it very difficult to get your own assignment peer reviewed even if you submit before deadline course content is not substantiated with research assignment instruction and grading criterion are badly misaligned which is probably why there is such a big backlog of old assignment from earlier session the person responsible for the course should take the following action aligning the grading criterion with the assignment instruction clearing out the backlog of assignment that have not yet been peer reviewed i estimate that there are still pending review many were submitted almost one year ago,1
488,weather it an act of self interest or not i don t really care fact is after viewing few video into the starting point where the legit content should appear i decided to stop it is a waste of my time he is either not teaching and providing the real solution or he doesn t really know much full of trash talk in generality negativity on point of view and outdated methodology that is not practical in the st century i have proof to my review,1
489,week long this is basically his class syllabus transferred to a mooc the first video wa a ridiculous waste of my time the videography wa totally unprofessional shaky camera this long walk and football kicking with a brain on the football field the audio is horrible use a mic i signed up for a neuro course not an advertisement of the campus this guy needed an instructional designer to help him condense and build this course into something digestible this is mooc not a college course i am horribly disappointed at the quality i needed an overview of the main component of neuro medical science,1
490,peer reviewed assignment are a joke assignment wa not verified which is not possible seeing how before you submit you have to verify assignment,1
491,doe not include latest development in this industry,1
492,totally useless why is she speaking so so so slow i put the playback rate at x in order to be able to understand her she is just making a summary in bullet of the reading that we are supposed to read anyway nothing new in the lecture if it wa not a part of the specialization i would never follow that course neither the other one taught by the same professor,1
493,the instructor is very bad she made the lecture so boring with her lack of preparation that i switched to just reading the transcript the assignment were lacking in case study and were very textbooky i could have skipped this course and simply read from the e book tried to get a refund but it too late so i will have to force through this one and the next i hope it doesn t adversely affected my grade a i have scored above in the previous course in this specialisation very disappointed and frustrated i came to coursera to avoid teacher and teaching style like this this really shake my confidence in coursera for future course im definitely not going to pay for any course in the future,1
494,all video lecture feel like they are just read from a paper and it take a lot of effort to follow and engage it is the th course i m taking to get ma digital marketing specialisation and is far off the poorest the slide don t make much sense and a lot of time i have to research stuff again on other website to actually get the point the quiz question are sometimes not related to the topic it seems like the professor doe not know enough about the subject to speak freely and engaging about the topic i m quite disappointed about this course and can not recommend it i think the course should be worked over a great example of how to do it right is aric rindfleischs lecture which wa engaging challenging and very well structured,1
495,professor is not engaging at all presentation skill are poor,1
496,this instructor is god awful i m sorry to say by the rd week i stopped caring about this class and my grade for that week definitely express my disinterest i m having to force myself to finish it ha she ever taught a class before i felt like this wa her first time uninspired not looking forward to her next class,1
497,the lesson on presentation skill and traditional medium should have taken just one one or two minute and one or two slide at most the detail and time invested really had little to do with digital marketing or the digital landscape the use of the hand written pro and con wa an unnecessary novelty regular bullet text are more readable and technically more reliable most of all the presenter s style wa distracting it seemed that she wa unsure of her subject matter and script i recommend re scripting and rehearsing the presentation before re shooting it finally with the rapid pace of change in digital we should not be using reading material more than two or three year old five year is tantamount to a generation in the digital world,1
498,this course seems to have interesting content and presentation but the quiz concern the material not covered in lecture or reading be it required or supplementary this is totally confusing,1
499,incorrect reference subtitle that do not follow the video question in the questionnaire that have not been studied and which one doe not even know where to find reference the worst course of this certificate,1
500,un organized scattered non professional course all the material keep changing during the course material in each module includes reading and exam were not related though i enjoyed the other course in this series and think they were great but i am afraid this one wa a real disappointment,1
501,shouldn t be presented a a course that is also suitable for english speaker it is not the english subtitle are completely incomprehensible,1
502,they have to put a note that this course is just for turkish student not for international,1
503,only one star a it wa not made clear you could also get point in assignment noted a tie but no further explanation i don t think i will bother with part,1
504,i advice not to take this course why the professor is never there to read your assignment he leaf that totally to other student like yourself to grade your written assignment and they do not read and give you a random grade in second don t take it you will waste sooo much time on this one,1
505,i could not upload a correct video a i do not have the knowledge to do so but i didnot get to finish the course which i think is unfair there should be some other way of uploading the homework i have given two star not because the course is not good but because i wa unfairly given le mark and a below is not passed did not get to complete the course,1
506,a lazy reviewer gave me the score of and left me this comment i am not able to give any score i tried very hard to understand the matter but it wa difficult for me i have to score it just for me to check the other student s work please don t consider my scoring here i studied hard and received this poor evauation i screamed for help many time but no one replied to my request the quality of the course is superb and my experience is completely ruined by a shitty score which doe not reflect my work,1
507,really poor approach to grade this course regardless of the effort put in on assignment peer review are inconsistent unguided and poor a a result bringing down the final grade one is likely to obtain on a course there is also a limited course support from the staff and no feedback in general for any of the issue raise personally i would not recommend,1
508,i have to apologize this course wa so out of date yes i learned a few thing but the recommended reading wa from and one of the assignment wa about an app that no longer exists had i not already purchased multiple class i don t think i would continue on i hope the next class are more up to date,1
509,the video are long and not engaging enough rather than digital marketing concept this wa more an application of trend to traditional marketing concept some of the topic are already outdated and some assignment were more applicable to those residing in the u s or are not exactly feasible to do at this point,1
510,didn t think that this is the best course for people who want to learn about digital marketing the learning process is very slow and sometimes i felt that more could be learnt by just reading a number of book or article on this topic there is no dialogue with the professor or anyone who ha more experience or knowledge the assignment are checked by people who are also taking this course though one would expect to learn from the assignment and mistake he or she make during it instead some people who have idea maybe even wrong one about this specific area of knowledge judge your work i could be also wrong about those thing and have to grade somebody s work which is a bit confusing besides the assignment are not very interesting or challenging i wouldn t recommend passing this course,1
511,imho a very superficial course lot of outdated material user generated content wa a big thing to year ago not anymore lacked going in depth it discouraged me from pursuing the rest of the specialisation,1
512,this course ha little or no information not at all what wa advertized too much peer stuff,1
513,not impressed with the teaching style seems that lecture were being read and not taught,1
514,need a sub can t not understand what he is saying,1
515,it is not what i wa expecting to learn from this course the course syllabus seems very good but the actual lecture are not good i would not recommend this course to any one i don t think we can call this a introduction of hrm because it doesn t give u any knowledge related with hrm the only new term to me is the high road v low road the rest is the common sense to me,1
516,nothing new to learn here this is very dull in contrast to other course of this spec i gave up watching the video after a while and try to pas anyway too bad this is part of this spec i wish marco or matthew taught this course too this course is very hard to follow and not interactive at all it should take the student through example live example the student can do too and thing the student build from scratch this doe nothing like that don t take this course if you aren t after the specialisation certificate it s not worth the time and effort too bad this spec includes this course it shouldn t be here,1
517,wa not a good a previous course in this specialisation,1
518,this is a complete waste of time the other course were really good but with this course i learned nothing newunlearned best practises from the previous coursesmick doesn t seem to understand what he is presenting himself at time the supplied code doe not match the video s the assignment change when i already submitted it from upload a zip to deploy and the assignment are copy pasted i think it would help to take this part out of the specialisation,1
519,the course content is really poor i do not recommend this course if you are actually interested in learning anything,1
520,concept on prospect theory is not explained correctly,1
521,the professor ha a very biased view of the islamic world which is heavily based on his opinion and approach not on the real fact and dominant his,1
522,the eeprom project in week is undoable with the specified simulator a the simulator is simply not functional i tested different computer window and mac operating system different browser different security setting etc nothing work the assignment is also way beyond the level of an introductory course in addition the complete lack of discussion forum attached to the course suggests that it is preferable to shut off discussion than to address the problem speaking of which a search of the general forum indicate that this ha been an ongoing issue since the latter half of seriously what the hell many people don t have a ton of extra money to throw away on garbage and you are selling a defective product,1
523,really bad explanation no code explain they left you on your own i t supposed to teach you not to left you undestand nothing they just teach component but the real thing the progaming is undeground no one know that kinda weird,1
524,the video are fine but it s simply terrible to force people to pay to be able to do the quiz there wa no such a thing in the first two course by the way i gave high rate for both it is ok to pay for the verified certificate however disabling the function in the course is a wrong way to earn money because people who want to learn the course might not necessarily want the certificate and this is unfair to them because it limit the resource available this whole specialization thing start to make me feel like you guy are in urgent need of money rather benefiting the community remember there are ton of free resource on the internet and this only undermines your strength you will lose ton of potential fan stop being seemingly arrogant,1
525,i understand it is a technical subject but going slide after slide reading the material without any clear explanation is not learning is just reciting it would have been better to try and put only half of the fact we can always search for specific flag and explain more about use case there ha to be a better way to pas the material,1
526,totally not what i expected most of it wa concerned with mathematical problem,1
527,my laptop wa not sufficiently fast to run oracle vm i m using ubuntu and there where no other instruction for how to install the oracle dbms,1
528,overall i wa disappointed with this course in the end i don t think it wa any better than any of the free online tutorial out there the instructor spoke so quickly in the video he wa nearly incomprehensible the explanation were incomplete at best and most of the time amounted to nothing more than type this now type this i m well aware that the only way to learn programming is by doing it yourself but if i pay for a course i expect an explanation of how thing work under the hood i wa looking forward to taking the entire ruby on rail specialization now i m not so sure,1
529,horrible the test make very little sense use element not described in the course and is generally very confusing,1
530,this is by far the worse course i d ever had taken if you are a beginner i suggest you go look somewhere else the software installation is hardly explained the instructor writes a whole bunch of code in the terminal without even explaining correctly what we are writing i abandonned this course because the instruction were not clear enough,1
531,very bad course too fast is not an introduction more like a remember of thing this course try to cover too much information in week and the assigments are not well guided and messy,1
532,no accurate help no feedback on the grader out of assignment where not specified correctly or just wrong this course will only teach you to be frustrated,1
533,are you a struggling programmer someone who doesn t know how to install software via command line not experienced with github if any of those describe you then this is not the course for you the professor seem to create an environment where if you are too new to anything then you should take a different course even though every module ha introduction to in the title doe coursera offer introductory course to ruby or ruby on rail other than this introduction course no,1
534,too much theory and not nearly enough practical model that i can use in my life or work disappointed so much of the class wa spent on describing many different model instead of focusing on one that can be applied readily,1
535,i feel that this course is not looked after teacher are not actively present there wa an error on one quiz and another assignment wa very poorly explained leading to many feeling like we lost mark due to not knowing exactly what wa expected of u many of the lesson waste time gushing over what s coming next but quite often the lesson itself feel weak and vague at some point i struggled to understand the point the lesson were trying to make i learned a few interesting thing but for the most part i m extremely disappointed with this course,1
536,got a far a lesson six took test and received have been trying without success to retake the test there doe not seem to be anywhere to try and find out how to fix this,1
537,not all apps wok on my device so i wa unable to do assignment apple annie wa difficult,1
538,repetitive content with other moma course seeing thru picture duh not gon na pay for this,1
539,it wa not the best course i did in coursera the teacher wa distracted and i had some issue in following her the information wa sometimes too basic and other time on much in depth,1
540,poor quality and heavily outdated content video quiz were broken more often than not module quiz question and answer were vague and poorly constructed resulting in choosing incorrect answer reading material wa of poor quality with many industry professional not being professional enough to perform a simple spelling and grammar check,1
541,the two or three minute video were annoying i understand that this is what video marketing is about and p not too many people truly watch the video lesson should be minute each,1
542,i am not very happy with this course it lack depth reading the text book give more understanding the video are just verbatim repetition of what is there in the book the concept are not explained well no example and no case study and further there are error in quiz the first course in this specialization wa really good course and were also very informative but and are not up to the mark and not meeting the high expectation set by the previous course,1
543,tortured by a platform glitch that initially denied me credit for my work and the certificate of completion but would not tell me specifically why turn out i needed to submit one additional peer review although i only found this out by contact customer service there wa never any explicit message telling me what wa required to complete the course and the information i did receive through the platform wa just plain wrong content of the course wa good but any feeling of accomplishment were overshadowed by the frustration of trying to straighten out what turned out to be a problem with coursera,1
544,while i learned quite a bit from the course i found the course to be far more difficult and frustrating than it really needed to be mentor were unhelpful and generally unresponsive during the course course content wa broken and or missing and the level of background in both calculus probability needed to truly understand the material in this course wa not obvious at all from the beginning in general the holistic experience of this course wa disappointing and frankly i would not recommended it unless you have a strong enough math background or are a glutton for punishment,1
545,not clear illustration many problem are not directly related to the content covered more importantly it suck,1
546,i did not enjoy how this course wa taught it wa confusing and hard to understand the professor did not go at a pace i found helpful,1
547,too much introduction not much actual useful stuff too much mathematically without well illustrated example,1
548,the course and indeed the whole specialization wa advertised a not requiring the graphlab create toolkit this is untrue a the final programming assignment doe require it the general dependence on sframe is understandable since it is open source but requiring any interaction with a licensed product even if temporary and research license are available greatly negatively impacted my experience in this course,1
549,maybe a good course but you need to be an it crack to be able to install the software and make it work online help doe not help irritating usd lost i don t recommend this course,1
550,the course is basically an advertisement for the software one of the teacher created i did learn a bit of high level concept but when it come to coding the answer is always conveniently my software doe this for you i wanted to actually learn about these concept deeper and implement them i also wa able to complete this week paid course in a few day which should not be possible i have since started the free stanford course taught by a co founder of coursera and it is much better i recommend it to anyone,1
551,shame that it wa not possible to progress with this course without using graphlab which the creator of this course himself created please see the course a just a training sale promotion for his ml application,1
552,no open source library this course is not educational it is a sale pitch to use their expensive software good luck having an employer pay this amount of money for software when they can hire employee that can use free open source library,1
553,too many video and not cluttered assignment code,1
554,dato tool doe not even install properly so n make no sense to continue with the course the support team fail to help in installing,1
555,i feel like it should have been mentioned a lot clearer before starting that this wa simply a course in how to use the creator library these skill are not transferable anywhere else a i would have to pay to use them in future would have been a lot more useful a a how to for sci kit and panda,1
556,the course ha a fundamental problem it relies completely on a library developed by one of the instructor which is not open source in the end it seems like a big opportunity of delivering a marketing campaign by the instructor then otherwise i definitely will not spend time and money on the other course of this specialization,1
557,i can not spend per year package just to learn this course sorry i am off,1
558,using a proprietary library instead of widely used library and discouraging the use of open source widely used library it barely compiles the example notebook ha method call that use non existing method of the sframe object the course claim that it teach the student how useful practical knowledge but then end up using a non standard library and saying not to use panda or scikit learn,1
559,the fact that the class us graphlab instead of panda numpy sklearn should have been stated up frontthe course felt like an advertisement for the professor s toolkitit wa very disappointing that the equivalent standard workflow wa not supported,1
560,i m not a conversational learner i like to learn via the puzzle method,1
561,this is very basic hence getting a certificate is not valuable i would consider getting a certificate if it mean something hence beyond a very basic crash course the certification should be i can really use and mean something,1
562,unfortunately not very engaging,1
563,im not finishing it since in the test are missing a lot of sound,1
564,not practical some audio file are not working,1
565,video proceed way too fast for complete beginner and thing are explained without enough underlying basic plus there is not really enough chance for repetition in the video tonal explanation are good except for the green line where you are not told how to choose what part of that tone to pronounce every time overall it could be a great course but fall short because the video proceed way too fast and without enough repetition or even practice exercise to be able to remember the phrase afterwards,1
566,the quiz in this course is not helping this learning experience to be positive,1
567,i signed up for this course hoping for a good introduction to oo programming and java only to not be able to verify if i have even learned anything of course i can access the course material but the fact that can not even manually check if my answer are correct with certainty make all of this le efficient than simply learning it by myself,1
568,the course doe not allow student to take part in quiz before paying for it but the quality of the course material is amazingly high and easy to follow,1
569,instructor are not to be found,1
570,it need project based exam not quiz these project exam should be a combination of automated programming task like the kind you find on hackerrank or codeforces and peer assessment based project that asks student to evaluate the readability of each others code a it currently stand this course is a joke,1
571,can not follow a single thing that they are talking about i have prior coding experience in other language and i still have no idea what the instructor are getting at they all explain everything horribly and jump into huge complex thing with no explanation worst course i have ever taken in my life,1
572,i advice not to take this course why the professor is never there to read your assignment he leaf that totally to other student like yourself to grade your written assignment and they do not read and give you a random grade in second don t take it you will waste sooo much time on this one,1
573,greed rule previously the course wa free including the quiz to check whether one learned something or not now you have to pay just to check your learning progress i do not need a certificate just learning for myself,1
574,unfortunately i think the level for this course is very low and not worth paying for it ha a very local perspective of logistics not involving international logistics but only u operation there s no communication with the professor or assistant so it s basically watching a few very short video explaining general concept that apply only to certain type of operation the assignment are very vague with no requirement or restriction provided basically anyone can write anything and a long a you follow the requested format it will be graded ok grading is not based content and therefore there s no way to know whether you re learning and applying the concept properly or not wouldn t recommend paying for it,1
575,could not follow very easily confused gained nothing from the lecture really no substance to it,1
576,there is a lot of material in this course that ha not been explained,1
577,the lecturer try to keep the instruction basic and pedagogical pretty good everything in this revolves around a tool graphlab create not so great i think it is not free you get a one year licence and hide all the action from the user i don t like that the course then make me feel that i must rely on a specific product to solve problem,1
578,i wa not aible to complete this course for free that wa very disappointing university like stanford and john hopkins find the opportunity to offer similar course free of charge to peoople who want to learn from university of washington i have expected the same your bad best regardskonstantin,1
579,this wa a really boring course not for the contet bu the teacher i fell bored every video because the theacher wa really slow in everything tha she wa showing it is realy dificult to get focussed in the real topic when the teacher spend a lot of time explaining thing at the end wont be evaluated a an example i am not english native speaker but a had to put the playback speed to x in order to not get bored in all video it wa really dificult to follow the teacher at the normal velocity i just got sleep every video and a a record i really like this topic so it is the tacher i took the first course and it wa a good experience but this one is owfull,1
580,i ve spent a bit of time going through the specialisation paid for one course here and other course online that offer machine learning with python i looked at book too i ve come to the conclusion that it s unforgivable to teach it using graphlab that you have to pay for after free licence expiry when everyone else teach scikit learn sklearn for good reason the tool used on this course are also not very good everyone else teach using text editor for a good reason you learn how to code properly the lesson are also dry and there are far too many of them,1
581,get way too in depth with the math behind regression to the point that it deters from the learning process wa hoping to learn better method of interpreting or enacting regression not the inner working of the algorithm assignment got overly complex with confusing instruction there are definitely some leap made in the assumption of what student python capability are vague instruction caused more frustration than desire to continue learning will continue in the specialization but will not hesitate to drop out if instruction continues like this very disappointed,1
582,with all due respect to the lecturer it obvious that he is intelligent and an expert on the subject i found this lesson not easy to participate because of inordinate learning curve and fast accent,1
583,week application assignment is buggy if you input correct answer they will be marked a incorrect you must use trial and error to find the wrong answer the quiz is looking for it s a badly designed assignment that waste student time and creates a lot of frustration would not recommend the course because of it,1
584,this course is not well moderated the material is confusing and the quiz were not tested before uploading them onto coursera this specialization is definitely not on par with other specialization i have done bluf there are better us for your money and time,1
585,test question for week are incorrect and do not match video reading had to go to youtube to figure out most of it,1
586,can not understand the diction,1
587,did not like the course complicated concept and poor representation i still really really appreciate the effort of those who put it together with their hard work,1
588,i do not like the course too difficult for me slide are too full of written line that professor navarro simply read,1
589,while the lecture were a little slow about providing information they were entertaining but i feel very mislead about the cost the lecturer repeated over and over how everything is free but in the end only the first course in the series is free then you must pay a monthly fee in order to go on i would not have continued with the first course if i d known that wa all there wa going to be,1
590,not worth your time,1
591,course did not meet my expectation i would not have paid the for it knowing what i know now i also found the lecture to be not very helpful,1
592,trivial course this week course can be easily completed in an hour i learned nothing from this course that i did not already know about python this course is strictly for beginner,1
593,very simple very slow for someone with programming experience it is a drug for someone new to programing i am thinking my son not very captivating,1
594,it doe not worth a penny to spend time in this course,1
595,poor feedback and advice with those who really do not know of programming to shame,1
596,this is not a start at the end of the course you still can t use python and even the tool don t work properly,1
597,speed is very fast for a basic level student the data explanation and correlation demonstrated is not clear,1
598,thanks for your effort to make video but this is the first time find a class that i can not submit my answer to check if it is correct or not before my account is upgraded disappoint to coursera and duke,1
599,too base for experienced people not enough fundamental for beginner after week didn t find any useful information it also very boring so recommend to see video on speed the course need to be significantly changed who are the target audience how many resource do we have time etc what we would see a a result of course knowledge skill hard soft etc,1
600,the course is not very useful due to it lacking of practical example and assignment,1
601,boring and not that useful,1
602,the material wa way to dry could not get interested in this class,1
603,this wa not really a course but a person talking in front of camera some jibber jabber and not much to learn from these talk at all if this wa a way for kimberley to increase her brand presence it did not go well talk were short with no real matter in them fill with joke just to make time with them i am sorry i did wait until the last lecture hoping that something will come out of it,1
604,background is not clear and not able to understand lecture,1
605,the professor teach by reading the slide and doe not even bother to explain the concept the course content might be interesting but now i m dropping this course because they are not explaining any concept but are just giving fact to memorize,1
606,course is overwhelming how can you put a minute video for a class can you divide it or make it simpler tutor is not explaning he only read he read sort of teleprompter and that s it boring very disappointed and this is not my first course in coursera i feel i m about to quit and this is the second week,1
607,the title are interesting and curious to read but the language is presentation of idea is not coherent the teacher doe not provide practical technique that can be used by a startup for marketing i wish there were many more example given and an applicable technique presented that i could use a an entrepreneur,1
608,this is purely subjective but i could not keep myself awake and sustain interest long enough to finish the one section i paid for i guess i should have tried one for free first i tried to tell the coursera staff to remove the course from my list and that i did not need my refund but sadly it sits on my enrolled course list perhaps permanently until i cancel my account luckily i did figure out how to turn off the almost twice daily notification,1
609,this course disappointed me i expected to receive knowledge about negotiation but it s more advertisement for the book i did every step in the course until the quiz and the quiz asks for knowledge which wasn t in the course i assume that i should have read the book to be prepared to do the quiz that s not why i registered on coursera,1
610,poor content only a book accompanies the video and we should not be forced to buy anything,1
611,really dreadful absurdly fast progress with really dry graphic where they cover the history of economics in about minute to make thing worse the lecturer who doesn t appear in the video speaks incredibly fast while graph and bullet point list fly by on the screen there s not time to process the information and complicated term and process are explained in just a few second i m disappointed a it looked like an interesting course but doesn t live up to some of the really great course available which employ great teaching and delivery,1
612,very boring not engaging at all us the phrase you know and um too much,1
613,not a positive act to make people pay to be able to participate in the quiz the other audited class allow everyone to participate in everything we just do not become certified if we have taken the class for audit rather than credit,1
614,can not do the test after module no reply from staff,1
615,the course wa not what i wanted,1
616,superficial treatment of the subject matter presentation wa awkward and slow and at time condescending in tone this whole course is equivalent to a hour seminar on how to live more positively presented at local community centre it is not university level learning instead it seems glib and lacking in substance,1
617,the concept of the course is excellent short video quiz activity the execution is extremely poor the short quiz often do not emphasize the element focused upon in the video or ask question addressed in the next video not the one just viewed or address issue that are not raised at all in this particular course but issue from other course in the specialization one is penalized for being late with assignment and must shift to a new session if one is late the weekly test are absolutely ridiculous they ask question requiring the application of concept which were barely covered concept which were not reviewed or which require real world knowledge which can not be assumed for someone who ha no experience in this field,1
618,it s really not good this course told u a very basic thing never give u deep detail and in most of course it show u the code and you should write like this but there is no deep understand what is it,1
619,this is not a business course explaining what an email is and how to send attachment is completely irrelevant information the title of the course should be more appropriate introduction to email what is it and how to use it or something that give people the idea that the course is about very basic information about email,1
620,file used were for an older version of meteor j which made installing the application and doing the assignment really confusing help wa not forthcoming and i eventually unsubscribed from the course,1
621,this is not a course for beginner even though you go through all previous the course there is no interaction at all with the professor or tutor the project are evaluated by your own classmate,1
622,it must be taught by someone who can speak english clearly sorry but i couldn t understand what mercedes paniccia spoke which made the course even more difficult to understand there are subtitle but it s not possible for everyone to put that much effort this issue must be taken seriously to make this mooc much better,1
623,i felt more like i wa part of some experiment to see how long i could tolerate boredom than that i wa in class where someone wa trying to share knowledge with me needle to say i did not make it to the end which is sad because i wa genuinely interested in the content the instructor s delivery wa absolutely monotone and he did not seem to emphasize the key point in any way so i found it very difficult to retain any information or to even stay awake at time,1
624,some exercise need some improvement test were not that helpful and the instruction to the last homework wa quite bad many open question,1
625,excellent teaching but it s not actually free you must pay in order to access the assignment and the professor s in browser python sandbox,1
626,instructor dr chuck is terrific however assignment are incredibly difficult you are supposed to spend no matter than a few hour a week on the course i spent over hour alone on the assignment the mentor that are supposed to help you did not help at all very poorly put together second module that doe not prepare you to complete the assignment,1
627,totally not worth having the certificate easy assignment good for people who never programmed before,1
628,way too easy assignment only good for people who never did any kind of programming for the rest it s not worth the money,1
629,it doe not touch hash table or stack just the common data type in python,1
630,no teaching just a guy talking do the problem set for practice if you need help pause the video and try the code out yourself seriously though a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it he doesn t work through code but talk around the concept,1
631,had i taken this course without prior knowledge of the subject without a doubt i would have quit the course after the first lesson a it is i gladly clicked the unenroll button after min into the start of the instructor s week three video i honestly don t know why i bothered to continue torturing myself a long a i did john holbo make grasping plato more complicated than it need to be in fact his lesson are nothing more than useless white noise and ill attempt at humour i recommend not taking this course it doe not offer any enlightenment but will only obfuscate and turn people off from wanting to understand plato,1
632,not what i thought it would be based on the intro,1
633,i wa very excited by the topic of this course but quite disappointed when i finally started it the content of this course ha little to do with it promising title in fact the content lack any coherency there is no logical development of the course content it s all disconnected fact told one after another another factor is the delivery i know the teacher are italian english is not their first language and that is fine but they are just reading out the content that s all they are just passively reading the content from somewhere so it is hard to concentrate because the interactivity value is zero and their accent take some time to get used to both content and delivery of this course were disappointing even though i wa and am really really interested in this topic,1
634,unfortunately this is a poorly designed course it seems like it is strictly scripted the instructor look like she s reading the material it s very boring to watch and a a student with a business background i learned zero thing related to pr or research everything discussed through this course is nothing beyond definition and general business knowledge she keep hinting on discussing the topic further in different section which didn t happen this leaf me confused on why not discussing it detail now discussing swot analysis is a strategic concern and a a pr related course we should see more related to marketing and communication technique a a result of the search but guess what it not there this course is not worth the money,1
635,except the fact that it wa taught well i believe that pressuring people work with a specific program to pas a course is not helpful i believe that instead of learning how to handle pro tool from scratch you should change the course to something more creative like recording different instrument measuring the studio space monitor and much more helpful thing than advertise and make avid richer friendlyall the best,1
636,it s a shame that almost all course are to be paid for nowadays for one i am not paying for it many will follow,1
637,the professor did not interact with people i wa wiling to see some discussion and contribution among people,1
638,just reading there are not video you are not allowed to submit the quiz if you do not pay,1
639,this course is garbage the instruction video are fine but the assignment are imprecise in their language at time and there are certain key point needed to complete them that aren t covered in the video the mentor in the forum is lousy and his response are worded a if he s talking with a peer and not a beginner student i may or may not try another coursera course after this but if this experience is any indication coursera isn t very good the same uofm course appears over on udemy and i wonder if it is just being repurposed on a many platform a possible without the care needed to make sure it work,1
640,the pedagogy of this course is disappointing because of a lack of sequential instruction large gap exist explanation of syntax and conceptualization of how the data flow seem incomplete i have looked at all kind of documentation a well a the book but i can not find what i need to know and this a barrier to completing the assignment the instructor s video have shown me very little of what i need to understand the concept the example show at most that is just a guess it is probably le of the knowledge that i need to complete the assignment when i ask question on the forum the first word i think when i read mentor explanation is cryptic,1
641,no teaching just a guy talking and sometimes complaining about imaginary student hypothetical thought do the problem set for practice if you need help pause the video and try the code out yourself seriously though a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it he doesn t work through code but talk around the concept,1
642,i m not able to submit my assignment,1
643,the peer review wa a waste of time some individual submit whatever other review whatever i found that the assessment criterion is not based on evaluating the quality of performed work and therefore have not really learned much from the capstone project i am taking another course which a well ha peer review i am rethinking if it s worth it do not see any value there is no real feedback from instructor if i need it a peer review i could just ask my colleague at work,1
644,you do not know what you are getting into until you take the first class what happen to the delete button on the class l,1
645,the course start with a short introduction on the topic of usability and user experience a good idea but not very well presented next is an intro to bootstrap ok but not deep enough for a course called responsive web design the last two week cover javascript or more precisely they cover a few javascript library to sum it up the course could really use a revision there are too many mistake in the example and sometimes the instructor look a bit unprepared and confused,1
646,i have always been appreciative of free course that are provided by university but this course is clearly biased the sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest a university is meant to teach the whole story and have a truthful account of fact i am deeply disappointed that so much fallacious content could be distributed to individual on the pretext of unbiased learning this course clearly ha an agenda i hope those who take it think critically about the subject matter and do their best to weed out what is reasonable and what is not,1
647,this course is clearly signposted a being supported by the templeton foundation and it show the course is short in term of length and weak in the term of developing idea the designer do not seem to understand properly what science is and what scientist do this is particularly evident in the final week an incoherent ramble the course strengthens my positive opinion of feynman s view of the philosophy of science in general i enjoy edinburgh university s coursera course but i shall be wary of any of a similar ilk and certainly won t buy the certificate this time,1
648,this course is not really free you must pay to access quiz and peer graded assignment coursera is really moving downhill quickly in term of free course offering it s such a pity,1
649,abstract when the assignment is related to psychology could you give u some not that professional article the whole course is not designed in a clear and logic way overwhelmed with so many term without clear explanation,1
650,repetitive content with other moma course modern art idea duh not gon na pay for this,1
651,please be advised that this course is not structured a a rigorous close reading but a general invitation into some central sentiment of the book of zhuangzi perhaps not the kind of course you are looking for in replacement of a serious college level class that survey the book,1
652,for a beginner course i would expect more exercise about the different control structure and built in mechanism in python this course did not really provide a good story to follow through but jumped around between loop input number conversion file i o and so forth,1
653,one could learn a much from any of many text this course doe not add value,1
654,sorry to say that this is not a well prepared course the course video provided is quite short the quiz is rather than nothing and the programming assignment are buggy i don t feel that i learned a lot from this course upenn ha let me down twice hope the rd one will be better,1
655,the course is so weak no enough illustration for the content of the course it s too short and not prepared very well,1
656,the assignment code is ambiguous and the assignment is not clear the lecture is not much helpful than i thought it would be overall i would not recommend this course if you don t need the certificate,1
657,very poor teaching extremely difficult to decipher what is important and will be tested and what is not they assume that you know terminology and concept that are not taught half of what they show you are told to ignore obviously smart and capable researcher but teaching the lay person is not their strong point,1
658,bad quality slide and presentation not possible to use headphone since it wa on mono not stereo interesting topic but not well executed to fit online learning,1
659,topic is interesting however the lecturer not quite lively,1
660,the instructor voice are so calm so i can not concentrate well,1
661,extremely boring and not,1
662,similar to other course in this specialization the material is very nice although slightly easy and straightforward but the course instructor do not moderate the discussion enough to make them a useful tool especially when i m paying for the specialization i would appreciate response to my question,1
663,in getting feedback from my peer review which i am very open to feedback however i guess i did not appreciate being told what i should or shouldn t do in my classroom with my kid i appreciate suggestion for improvement but i felt that more critique wa on my teaching style than my writing again i appreciate feedback but unless in my classroom with my kid and doing something i have done numerous time at the request of my own principal i did not thin it wa fair also a a teacher there is never just one way of doing thing there is always multiple way and being told to do it one way there way wa not appropriate at least for me so this course although very,1
664,since there is a lot of math involved there should be some carefully written reading not only slide or phd thesis,1
665,this course is not even considered a an introduction it s a complementary for those whose career is robotics in other word the required prerequisite are more than matlab programming skill and some calculus and algebra it assignment have many problem that can not be solved using just the course studying the course doesn t give many information,1
666,the quiz and assignment are poorly designed important issue are overlooked or just briefly discussed in lecture the assignment focus on matlab coding which only emphasizes the coding technique do not recommend to audience with,1
667,this course wa not a beginning level course a advertised test case for assignment were neither document nor otherwise explained within the course material quiz during the lecture were often unrelated to the material just presented or were given before the relevant material wa taught the course creator obviously put a lot of time and effort into this course so it is difficult for me to write such a critical review however they missed the mark with this one enough that i can t recommend the course unfortunately i will not be completing this course only due to the fact that i have run out of time and patience to complete the last assignment,1
668,this is a totally theoretical course this actually doe not help to build a quadcopter from the scratch it should have been mentioned in the introduction i am opting out the lecture did not seem appropriate for the people without proper background not satisfied,1
669,really bad course they don t explain the concept clearly the quiz ambiguously ask thing not seen in the video and the instructor introduces equation without further explanation the course autonomous navigation for flying robot edx is much better,1
670,requires matlab in my view a university should not be promoting a proprietary product there have been other cousera course which used octave the free software implementation of the programming language implemented by matlab i have seen no good reason why octave should not have been used for this course,1
671,i would give this course star if possible i am amazed that anyone rated this course better than or star the lecture are not focused on the information that is necessary for the obnoxiously long and tedious assignment the assignment are poorly written and demand too much ruby expertise for a course meant for ruby novice i spent over hr trying to complete week s assignment and still could not finish i became so frustrated and actually angry at how difficult this course is designed i decided to quit coursera should not allow there to be course that evoke such frustration and emotion john hopkins should be embarrassed that their name is associated with the pedagogical malpractice that is this specialization series foolishly i paid for the entire specialization up front and coursera refuse to refund me for the remaining two course which i have not even taken,1
672,unacceptable assignment length the reason somebody would enroll to distance programme is due to personal high workload it took me week not hour a tutor mention to complete half of the second assignment and i am about to tell that i learnt nothing about mongodb the video cover the very basic and in order somebody to complete the assignment need searching in the internet the video must change to include more detail about the presented topic i am about to drop out of the specialization only because the specific course,1
673,too much talking in a lot of these course offering i have add and i can not take excessive talking,1
674,in my opinion this course doe not teach you to speak english professionally but it teach you to learn how to speak english i wa looking for a course that would teach me how to write professional email and have professional phone conversation like which word i should use what common sentence are or how to build up professional sentence i am a bit disappointed and think this course wa a waste of time for me this is really meant for people that are learning to speak english and don t know how to pronounce word or how to respond to people in a really easy way,1
675,instructor is not clear and too fast,1
676,no teaching just a guy talking do the problem set for practice if you need help pause the video and try the code out yourself seriously though a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it he doesn t work through code but talk around the concept,1
677,in just the first week i found several quiz question that are not correct example code in quiz is not complete spacing and indentation are incorrect in quiz sample i realize this is probably to prevent copy paste testing of code but you can not answer is this code correct if you don t know where they wanted indentation to line up lecture presentation is not very engaging almost seems like the female instructor wa forced to stand in front of a camera and read note card withdrew early,1
678,this is a really weak and not very smart course compared to the other two in this specialisation strategy formulation strategy implementation,1
679,the actual material in the course is fascinating and quite useful but a is common with so many coursera course the enjoyment of completing the course is severely hampered by the requirement to review the final assignment of other student the purpose of these course is to learn from expert in the field not to grade the work of others i wish coursera would really stop professor from pushing their responsibility grading the work of the student and offering their feedback onto the student who may or may not have a firm grasp of the material in question,1
680,although the information on the course state that it requires no prior programming knowledge that statement isn t accurate you will quickly become lost in the assignment and question a they are a not a logical progression from the lecture material the instruction from mr peng is all over the place and doesn t give you a good understanding of the language i found swirl to be more helpful but looking at the upcoming material you need to have a solid background in programming to complete this specialization which should have been told to student prior to them spending money on the course i would not recommend this course to anyone,1
681,possibly the least well structured class ever also not made for people to actually learn how to program in r it is sad that i paid for this and ended up going to another resource to learn and it wa much much easier,1
682,damn near worthless the course material ha significant gap of information the programming assignment require knowledge that isn t presented in the course i had to google my way through this entire course i would not recommend it,1
683,honestly i m very disappointed with this course the content taught in this course is not in accordance with the assignment it is like someone taught to be a builder and asked to build the brooklyn bridge not fair at all if you are going to ask to build a bridge teach me how if you teach me how to be a builder ask me for a wall not a bridge,1
684,assignment do not match up well with the lesson and the lesson are bad they are not educational,1
685,very painful training the content reviewed in the material will not make you capable to solve the weekly assignment you will have to learn what you need on your own to me the only value added of this course is that i will receive a proof that i know how to define basic function in r,1
686,somewhere during the second week there is a gap in coding that i could not overcome and this ruined the whole interest in pursuing the course because in order to overcome it i had to cheat i don t feel like i am learning anymore,1
687,homework wa poorly structured and not adequately discussed in the lecture video had to dig through several buried link to make any progress on the homework assignment,1
688,course doe not do a good job actually explaining r or training you on how to properly use it the lecture go over the material very fast and you do not get much out of them and then the assignment throw complex problem that are very difficult you spend most of your time googling to learn it and i find that i would have learned r better if i just did that to start without this course maybe if you aren t new to r and have a programming background it may not be so bad but if you are new to r and not an experienced programmer this is not the class to take to learn it,1
689,i m giving this course one star because zero star is not an option i wish i had read course review prior to beginning first assignment wa tough but do able second assignment seems straight forward but the template they ask that you follow contains small trick which appear to be far beyond anything touched on in lecture i m actually going to fight for my money back what a scam,1
690,the jump from the lecture material to the assignment wa way too much in order to complete the assignment one need to spend lot of time learning thing not covered in the course,1
691,this is way too esoteric the content wa delivered way too fast for me to keep up and process it this need to be taught with more frequent hand on example i m also not sure why if auditing we can t submit and see how we re doing on the learning i have no way to evaluate if i m picking up the concept or not which is a struggle overall i would not recommend this course for r beginner i would look elsewhere,1
692,this course wa so convoluted and not practical that it made me lose complete interest in the specialization,1
693,this course is the worst course that i have taken so far i am not happy with the course content and the way that the lecturer us to teach this course i really want to refund my money,1
694,not a class for the beginning programmer the lecture do not line up with the assignment and if you don t have programming experience you could easily spend hour week figuring out how to finish the assignment,1
695,not the model of learning that is encouraging or stick hard for a student even one who ha a programming background to sit through hour of slide explaining what the function and definition in the language do without a layer of use context upfront the content jump from specific example to unrelated specific definition without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course the whole course seems disjointed would have been much more effective a learning through example and to be taught function and definition a they come up in problem solving,1
696,i managed to complete this course but that wa because of my four year of mooc level programming experience and duckduckgo google not because of the course material video are dull reading of the pdfs with many ummmm s and annoying lip click example are useless explanation are often vague or even incomplete the assignment are relatively hard in that you don t get all the necessary info from the course sometimes even r s own manpages aren t enough which is a shame a you d expect a course to teach you how to use the tool you will need for the assignment if you have no programming experience stay away from this course otherwise if you want to learn r look for other resource and save yourself some time and money,1
697,the course is misleading the difficulty ramp up too quickly with the result that those who do not have a programming background will not be able to keep up it should be toned down and reworked or split into two course cramming everything into week make everything too difficult,1
698,the new platform suck the people who just want to learn for free and not purchase a certificate are barred from attempting the quiz unlike the old platform not being able to take the quiz completely ruin the learning experience,1
699,in lecture rate of speech is really fast and in some presentation are not clear,1
700,completely lost this is not meant for rank beginner data camp s free r course ha been much more helpful for me than this it doesn t have the same level of detail a this but at least i m not watching an instructor gloss over concept or idea that are completely foreign to me a someone completely new to programming,1
701,the video lecture will help you to pas the quiz a they are primarily theory and background the lecture will not however aide you in any way in completing the programming assignment the first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lecture the textbook or in swirl to pull all of the piece together prior to the first programming assignment quiz there are so many disparate concept that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in r how to properly import the data create the file structure the data and then perform some analysis these concept are introduced throughout the course but never brought together in one complete project,1
702,not for new programmer the lecture material is also not logically organized and doe not correspond to the assignment,1
703,week is an unreasonably difficult jump from week this course s beginner friendly lecture do not align with the level of understanding needed to complete the assignment,1
704,assignment not always in line with lecture material is above beginner level,1
705,only the most basic of instruction for r which are bland and easily read in the documentation or other free resource there are very few best practice or real example to use anything found within the quiz and assignment do not match the lecture material and are contrived not worth the money,1
706,waste money and time do not explain very well,1
707,beware if you are someone who is new to more advanced math or to any sort of coding this course will be very confusing totally unpractical and you ll walk away not feeling like you ve really learned how to use r in a real way i wa incredibly disappointed,1
708,i generally think the course need a lot of improvement a after week the assignment and quiz don t seem to relate to the course content we are at very different level so a more gentle easing and explanation of idea is necessary other than this apparent quantum leap from one stage to the next i have had to do a different course else where and i am getting the sort of good introduction into the r language it not practical to expect everyone to understand the idea in week programming is hard enough a it is,1
709,wow awful presentation but great instructor i expected much more than this but leveraging employer brand is not compelete,1
710,there should be an instructor available to address specific grading concern peer grading is too subjective and student use their opinion a opposed to rubric for grading and often do not read all the material prior to assigning a score,1
711,too general no depth not recommended for science or engineering degree holder,1
712,material is very high level no ppt s are given so all link presented in the video s can not be viewed quiz are based upon old package so incorrect answer are provided no reply at discussion board from ta s or instructor,1
713,can not take the exam i have to pay wtf i will probably pay at the end but i want to take the class first without certificate i can not prove i took the course,1
714,project description versus requirement were terrible not sure if the new coursera format played a role in the issue or not quite a few of the homework item require guessing a the answer don t align to the result of the latest tool they have you use if the first class or three in the series wa like this i wouldn t have taken the course,1
715,too much surface not enough depth,1
716,i wa really disappointed with this course i took the other course from brian caffo and truly enjoyed them for the previous course i ve always used the book and they helped me tremendously to be able to comprehend the material there is a book for regression model but but it s a real mess it feel like a draft that no one cared to take a second look there is a bunch of wrong code and typo the explanation doesn t go a far a it should i had to resort to many different source just to be able to get by the course i hope the instructor review this course soon because it doe not have the same quality a others if they don t review it don t bother paying for it try learning regression model elsewhere,1
717,content and quizz are not aligned mentor answer to of the forum post poor student community do not pay for this course just follow the swirl and or get some tuto about regression,1
718,this course is not organised so well concerning grading process there is a lot of mistake in the criterion of grading also the material is not so good i learn nothing new the worst course i took in coursera actually so no star go to this course,1
719,poorly designed course which test people on thing that are not taught,1
720,it is not well done a the previous course the quiz usually do not concern the topic of the lesson or better the lesson do not help in anyway to solve the problem,1
721,the quiz do not relate to the lecture a lot of think need to be explore in document outside of the course and the knowledge of the student ha to be higher not a course for not engineering background,1
722,course lack wider and real socio political context of the xix and xx century central and eastern europe additionally it is full of statement that are not supported by the historical fact,1
723,it wa too bad to not permit the student to perform the quiz only if we pay for them i thought the payment wa for the certificate,1
724,the soul belief course seems to try presenting thing in an unbiased manner yet they can not hide their bias if the intention wa to hold up various belief in the past then try to shoot them down they partially succeeded most rational believer however could still hold onto their belief because the argument were very weak a better title for the course would be why there is no soul that way going in a student would realize that there actually wa a hidden agenda,1
725,unorganized and not very useful the main goal of the course is for you to use stack overflow save yourself,1
726,please provide the complete unit detail i could see only this unit is open for past many month i paid for all unit money already and not in a position revert back and get the money could you please help me out to understand when this course will be available if not in near future why are they taken money before the course is not ready to u quite disappointing experience,1
727,i am an engineer and i use matlab and stata for data analysis and currently taking machine learning course by stanford which is fabulous i did not like this course for the following reason bad course design structure so confusing and inappropriate sequence super fast without providing any intuition no fundamental explanation course could be longer and spend enough time in each subject,1
728,instructor is too fast video lecture are not enough and assignment question are not clear which waste much time just to understand the question,1
729,terrible course assignment are extremely buggy and often touch on thing not even explained in the lecture mentor are not active explanation are sketchy and not well paced do this course only for the example in the jupyter notebook,1
730,lesson were ok but the assignment were really frustrating not because of the question itself but because the question were organised badly or were really vague and confusing,1
731,the jupyter notebook made this a horrid experience plus coursera really doesn t want you to bother them with your silly question relying on peer forum if you scroll through the week s discussion forum many student post go ignored you can t drop the course past the second i guess week so the system will keep on keeping on long after you ve given up on trying to figure out the janky notebook thing will not return to coursera for any reason breathtakingly bad experience,1
732,besides the major technical issue and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issue the way of teaching is well adapted to on site class where you can sit in study group solving the problem together the given example have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignment and according to the staff the best way to solve assignment is by using google or stackoverflow or whatever really somehow it seems they just took an on site course played with some fancy technical solution and call it now a mooc they seem not really aware of the fact that on site teaching and moocs require completely different type of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best mooc dr chuck s and one of the worst this one,1
733,this course is good but instructor is very bad not providing good course lecture and material the lecture is very fast and not covering all the thing being asked in the assignment i am leaving this course due to this i have successfully done other python course because there the instructor wa very good and his teaching style wa awesome i have wasted lot of my time enrolling in this particular course though the course conception is good instructor and course material are not up to the mark,1
734,assignment are ambiguously phrased and full of inconsistency and typo the last assignment doe not provide feedback at all it mainly felt like sitting in a lecture theatre getting a fragmented overview of the lecturer s work while never gaining a real handle on the wider context or what would have happened if an action hadn t been taken had been performed differently there wa not enough further reading and no discussion of other people s work such a a dissection of how a company might have arrived at a product we can actually identify in the wild rather than learning how i could tackle any project i now know how to work on very specific example of project if anything wa to deviate from this i d still be clueless overall the course feel haphazard and badly prepared,1
735,this course doe not meet my need and expectation the content is very focused on engineering project the exercise demand a lot of time to understand the document it would be better to slice it in many exercise associated with each week,1
736,i could not understand instructor using subtitle didn t help either a many word came up unintelligible,1
737,boring voice a lot of overcomplicated term where you can describe your idea in a much more simple way in result i feel that lector read this material not to teach people but just to read it disgusting,1
738,it is more like a junit course in the beginning or a far a i could watch the methodology is not very precise and i could think in a few enhancement still i could recommend for those who want just a initial contact with the method no more than this,1
739,i d like to give just one star rating for this course a it is very far from what i expected the course expect student to know python to know r but did not go deep enough to help student understand the insight from social medium data in fact lot of r task can be replaced with python so the course could be designed in a much better way that student do not always switch between two programming environment this course mainly teach how to download data with keywords and how to plot graph not worth the effort of learning therefore i would not recommend this course to anyone,1
740,i don t recommend this class jogesh k muppala ha very labored english and his pace and verbosity make the lecture hard to get through i ve turned in around assignment and have yet to get a grade on anything the course content is poorly organized and executed peer grading is just dumb and clearly doesn t work since i have yet to get a single assignment back when you turn in assignment file they can not be opened and we found out from an apparent student how to get past the technical issue question about the class and submitting assignment went unanswered my advice save your money and don t take this class,1
741,it is too hard to understand what he is saying his accent is impossible to follow besides the lecture are not dynamic it is just him reading the slide with the most monotonous and boring voice ever i took the first course of the specialization with david and this is the complete opposite i would love to see the whole course with david and not only the first one,1
742,first the assignment always had poor instruction it wasn t until grading time you would find out what the criterion are after your assignment is submitted secondly there wa no documentation help for the fact the window need a webserver to run content in this section many version of window can t do this discovered resolved over many hour when course content would not work the actual course content wa sparse not much to it other than bootstrap bootstrap bootstrap after how good the first course wa how much ground it covered this course wa frustrating poorly documented and a disappointment,1
743,difficult to understand not a good explainer,1
744,first course by david rossiter set the bar very high this is like going through a manual or series of instruction would like course to be taken by david and by jogesh else the style becomes very monotonous the course by david wa awesome this is not a good,1
745,this course wa very boring and very frustrating long long slow lecture with lot and lot and lot of question and no answer the briefest of comment on potentially interesting people or topic but no link to enable those to be followed up quiz on concept not covered in the material conflicting description of assessment requirement discussion moderator who continually referred you back to the course material which did not contain the information that people were looking for before taking this course i could find only one negative review which i dismissed a probably being a minority having taken the course i agree with that review wholeheartedly i did learn a couple of thing despite everything but i would not recommend this course please upgrade it substantially,1
746,in compare with first course of this specialization study material are too few some lecture not longer then minute the whole time of lecture minute,1
747,course wa taught by people who gave no indication they had ever bought a security they read flatly from the teleprompter and rarely looked at their audience very disconcerting and not conducive to trusting what is being said,1
748,not happy about the course very very general information this can be obtained through any internet reading and doesn t require a purchase of the course dollar is not peanut for many country the lecturer often refer to the video which are not part of this course example ppp valuation ha not been part of lecture but is referred to maturity and duration of the bond comparison with the glass of water is referred to but wa not part of the course for the money we are getting some shorter version of a bigger course not satisfied at all just finished all the test and passed but not happy do not recommend to anyone and surely will not buy the next course,1
749,i ve taken this course for a while but prefered to stop a i found it very not academic in term of ethic and objectivity it spread anxiety and take too much liberty with history,1
750,i want to bring it to coursera s attention that this specialization on conflict management is poor quality poor value and hardly any content week is only a welcome lecture it is a week course stretched out to month so that student can be charged money it should not be a paid specialization it doe not meet coursera s high standard can you please forward this review to the right person,1
751,some material are useful but the teacher ha no idea of teaching technique and good presentation very bad choice for the university of irvin california to entrust such an interesting course to such an incompetent and feeble instructor she is reading in a monotonous way and nothing more her presentation have no meaning she doe not appear in the video lecture she can not introduce animated element the material she selected are sometimes and only somehow relevant the most of the material have only percentage and small detail on history a course of poor quality,1
752,this course and the specialization a a whole is poorly structured and a rather cursory overview that is unlikely to satisfy serious learner if the material is completely new to you then it will likely leave you confused a it doe not adequately explain the concept if you are already somewhat familiar and are looking for deeper dive into r and programming you will be disappointed a the course just don t have the depth of material needed to gain mastery over the subject your money and time would probably be better spent on a couple of book by wickham,1
753,this course is not free you must pay to access assignment and quiz i am really annoyed with the direction coursera is moving in regard to premium content if they keep up this trend i ll move to class central or other moocs,1
754,content is not good too scattered content can not find focus assignment are meaningless,1
755,wa expecting soo much more from the entire course not a single practical part soo much talk and write sorry would not share the course with friend is too much for what i have just learned,1
756,very bad and not organised,1
757,it is a poor course because is not properly designed for international language is mainly french in slide and subtitle is not that helpful instead of spending time outside to read the note it wa better to prepare helpful slide for student to understand better what you are talking about,1
758,seems like the quality of this specialization go down with every course the instructor is not showing u the way we should think about developing program in nodejs but he insists on using powerpoint slide to show u how to code it s and there are way better medium for communicating with your student simply copying and pasting code and explaining what every line doe is not the right way of teaching any concept especially when you are dealing with a new technology for the start the instructor can actually type the code and explain what go through his mind during each step that way anyone can follow his problem solving method and benefit from the course i had to take other online course on code school and pluralsight just to understand what s going on and later come back to finish the homework,1
759,content of the course is great but if you get stuck in a problem no one responds or guide you for practice purpose just take the free version paid version is not worth taking a you will not get any additional guidance or support to do assignment when stuck,1
760,the marking scheme for essay is filth i wa not even informed what the passing mark is before i received my grade all the instruction for assignment are absurdly unclear also the professor s english is terrible,1
761,while the course is very interesting i found the peer review process unsatisfying i did not enjoy grading others without knowing if i wa right grading a fellow student on their accuracy when i don t know if they are actually wrong is something i never want to do again after completing the course i had hoped to learn if any of my assignment were actually correct i am disappointed in the outcome,1
762,i can not unenroll this course it s very terrible,1
763,this course wa a extremely introductory course in excel i would not recommend it to anyone especially at the cost of aside from getting yourself thinking about using excel and some minor lesson learned i found it to be a complete waste of time,1
764,really basic spreadsheet knowledge not to be recommanded for anybody who is already familiar with excel,1
765,this course doe not belong to this specialization poor content poor assessment quiz and felt quite disappointed it is way below par i never thought i would have to rate it this bad if not for specialization that i am aiming for i would never take it period,1
766,the test were not upto the mark where the question were not very logical and the option were confusing,1
767,i had great expectation but the course focus on really basic stuff if you have worked with spreadsheet before it won t help much if you haven t it will not teach you how to use it,1
768,frankly speaking it should be the most disappointing mooc i have ever enrolled so far the professor s teaching is clear and comprehensible but the depth of the course content can not meet the university level especially from a worldwide renowned school like wharton quiz is the most terrible part which seems like nobody could get it because of the ambiguous question and paranoid answer area personally i like many other mate am really grateful to coursera for offering everyone this equal opportunity but course with that kind of quality but staggering price will destroy the company s brand we all want coursera to go further and better but few people prefer monopoly businessman rather than prestigious professor and diligent intellectual,1
769,this wa very disappointing especially considering it s a wharton product the course wa little more than an afternoon s worth of seminar since i am not a paying participant i could not take the quiz so i finished watching the video in le than a day in addition there are no collateral or supporting material provided none of the spreadsheet or workbook illustrated in the video are available anywhere on the course site despite their being advertised in the video all in all it wa consistent with the first course in this specialization again very disappointing i m glad i didn t spend any money on this,1
770,this course would be much better if there wa some actual substantive content this course wa not worth,1
771,i do not recommend you to waste your time planned course activity for a week just minute speech of the lecturer telling absolutely banal thing and a few question absolutely useless,1
772,the provided material is good but not good enough to be called a course it seems more like a talk not a course i suggest to add more material or merge with other course,1
773,unfortunatelly i did not get anything from this course the course wa based on a few obvious tip you get from any self help or management book,1
774,i dont recommend this course to anyone the course content is not up to the mark,1
775,seemed like the capstone wa rushed and turned into an investment management course i signed up to practice business finance modeling not investment management the instructor did not present any further information and referred student to third party resource ie investopedia and youtube many student in the forum voiced their frustration disappointing course with little added value and in my opinion hurt wharton s image overall the wharton online business finance modeling specialization is not worth the u if i could i would ask for a refund,1
776,the lesson are not very clear and have almost no example to make matter worse the discussion forum were closed so you could not ask anything to clarify thing so it wa very difficult to learn thing here,1
777,i enjoyed the other course in this specialization but the capstone wa disappointing the course wa not very structured and did not draw from the other course in a substantial way it wa often difficult to see how the reading related to the project the course could use a lot more curation and direction,1
778,the whole course is nice and there were lot of new thing to learn i am not from an it background but still found it very useful however the capstone wa a bit of disappointment i believe they should have included some teaching authority to check the capstone project for my better understanding the whole capstone is reviewed by peer which is great but a per certification i believe there should be some professional help too i even tried to speak to someone over the phone but there wa no number available i ended up with chatting with some one on the help center but that wa not very helpful either the course content for operation analytics and people analytics were indeed very useful thanks,1
779,the preceding course were interesting and helpful this capstone project lacked substance the project did not allow itself to apply many of the concept learned throughout the course it s almost exclusively about customer analytics i would not be surprised if yahoo worked with wharton and coursera to launch this course in order to crowd source idea on how to turn around the company,1
780,this course is very basic provides a lot of information that s not really practical or useful i suppose someone who s seeing internet for the first time would find it informative but not very engaging a for the majority of those who use coursera to self educate it would probably seem a bit too much of stating the obvious also i d like to mention the delivery of the information it a text that s read aloud nothing more well thanks for that i can read faster than i can listen to a video if you re making a video make it worth actually watching,1
781,i do not intend this to be mean but i could not listen to richard waterman i am british and i understand that richard wa born in the uk but spent a great many year in the u if he had a britii really struggled to listen to him a his accent cross the atlantic several time a sentence i found i couldn t listen to what he wa saying because i wa so distracted by how he wa saying it i am sorry there is probably nothing that he can do about it and the course looked very interesting but i simply could not bring myself to continue,1
782,the course is poor exam are too easy video lesson are boring and not engaging content is poor too did not like the course,1
783,the instructor say in the first video you do not need to read a book on how to write a script in my opinion you do better to read a book or two than waste your time on this course the video are extremely short shallow and a waste of time,1
784,slow video repeating several time the same thing not a pedagogical good to fix an idea kind of repetition which make them hard to follow however the worst are the exercise the first time after other coursera scala related course where i have to actively check the forum for minute detail about what is expected implied for the solution to pas the grading thing like what to do when updating the kmeans and you have duplicate subtle difference between average and mean etc in all other course the expectation of the exercise were sufficiently clear and straight forward that i never had to check the forum to solve them also the code style of the exercise is literally an anti pattern in idiomatic scala against everything learnt in the previous scala course var all over the place low level loop like in c or java etc,1
785,not that much technique to learn just general course about social medium so it s not cost effective,1
786,it provides a broad overview but material are not very refined and the course doe not provide a good structured approach to the subject at least it did not for me leaving me wondering a to what next step could be if i wanted to explore further,1
787,after watching so many video like how i got started on seo how to find a job a seo how to answer in an interview for seo job i ve realized this course really need to focus on what people want to hear we want to learn seo not how someone got started on seo,1
788,unfortunately this wasn t what i expected from the course maybe since i didn t take specialization but i feel that this course wa too theoretical i understand the history of seo but i m not confident how useful it ll be in real life commercial sense,1
789,i have a negative opinion of the structure of this course it is not laid out in a format that i a native english speaker understood the interview and recorded lecture were not adequate or sufficiently rehearsed the gentleman that drill his own cavity in his home workshop wa most annoying and pointless looked at the ceiling buddha of his screen time the reading wa too disjointed and the book on mindfulness is really more commercial and repetitious that one would expect of a course in coursera professor wright is too laconic phlegmatic and unengaging i wrote the assignment for week three but there were no instruction on how to convert a document in textedit mac wp to the course submission page so that wa a total crash for me i would never recommend this course to anyone,1
790,i am just not feeling this course i have done up to week five and still am not hooked sorry,1
791,without a doubt the worst course i have ever taken anywhere when the instructor who is supposed to be teaching you how to write io apps take no exaggeration six minute to even figure out how to open xcode you know you re in for a rocky ride still i stuck with it for three more week to my horror the course only got worse from there this course wa clearly thrown together with a minimum of effort by someone who is not qualified to teach the subject it s an insult to coursera customer and a major failure of quality control,1
792,the material and video are so poor and low quality i am happy to not have bought this course,1
793,that s terrible i can t see any english subtitle added to this course besides test are not relevant to the content taught in the video,1
794,the course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive there are many example in it but they are all high level example which are not really going into the detail of the creative process the high level process proposed is good but it is into the detail where the process fails and there are no detailed example here by far the worst thing related to this course is the peer review they define rule which nobody respect and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined i really regret my decision to join this specialization and the waist of money,1
795,it a very superficial course it feel like the instructor is just reading out from some material and it is not making it interesting to listen the instructor is not putting in much effort to make student understand the concept that s the reason for me to drop out in between the course this course is not at all much informative and neither it is improving my grasp on the topic,1
796,i would not recommend this specialization to anyone the first assignment is just a first review of the final project but it is almost impossible to pas because the question are not organized in a manner of constructive feedback,1
797,could not finish the course i found the course to be boring,1
798,i do not want to rate this course at this stage but i would like to make the following comment in relation to the course resource and in particular the answer to the exercise in the optional text book for student who do not have a copy of the text book providing answer to question from the text book without showing the actual question is not very useful and to be quite frank ridiculous i would like to think that the course designer would take some sort of appropriate action to remedy this how exactly this would be done is up to the course designer but i would suggest that another downloadable pdf document showing all the question would be extremely useful and necessary i look forward to a response regard trevor farley,1
799,honestly i only finished week i wa sorely disappointed that the quiz were locked i wasn t aware that if you audit the course you were not allowed to complete the quiz a other course offer this option from what i gather from week the course topic seems really good i think it would be great if you consider letting person who audit take the quiz otherwise what s the use i mean i could always go on youtube and watch video on the same topic the difference with coursera course is that you get the opportunity to test the knowledge gained by doing quiz and assignment i hope you will consider allowing everyone to take the quiz my issue above is the reason why i gave the course a out of,1
800,this is a course for student with little or no work experience i ve been in the industry for twenty year and found some good information but the quiz aren t designed for experienced adult learner not being able to discus with the professor why an answer is incorrect or even knowing exactly what about an answer make it incorrect further distance the student from learning given that one essentially spends an extra work day each week on the course i expected more value for my precious time this week i decided the value isn t there i might recommend the course for undergrad student but not for working adult,1
801,the entirety of this course can be taught in a few sentence if there is too great a sacrifice to productivity for the sake of security then people will find a way around any security mechanism in place if something is difficult to use then people will likely not use it,1
802,sorry but this is awful literally just reading from some very high level slide no dept to the course i can not recommend this course in it current state,1
803,this is certainly not an depth look at smartphone technology the lecturer just read aloud the text on screen without fleshing out the concept therein or providing any explanation anybody can tell me what an acronym stand for i want to know what these feature actually do how they work how they re developed i have no desire to upgrade to the whole package for this course it s a time waster,1
804,this is only theory related to the evolution of the system how their feature change over the time i personally think that it is useless because you really do not learn anything,1
805,a a professional instructional designer i can attest that this is the poorest designed course i have ever seen regrettably i paid for the entire specialization up front and i can not get a refund or even a coursera credit for enrolling in a different specialization be aware that the faculty who is the instructor of record doe not participate in the course the video lecture are poorly done including error and misstatement that could have been edited out but it appears that no one bothered to edit the raw footage before uploading it there is not so much instruction a an overview there are no coding exercise until the final assignment which is poorly described and requires the student to self teach using outside source there are app specialization in coursera that appear much better designed look elsewhere,1
806,course content some swift specific topic are shortly covered in the video overall the teaching material is very short in the first week student basically learn how to start xcode week four contains a minute video on image processing that s basically it for the week follow up reading for week two just provide a link to apple s io developer site that s clearly not enough for a course student can google for tutorial by themselves project the project mention class which are not covered in the course it wa then also my impression from the peer review that some student without prior knowledge were just lost there are many great tutorial on the web which offer more insight and give student a much more fundamental knowledge than this course,1
807,the course wa not prepared at all badly improvised and with no structure i wish i could have my money back,1
808,this wa thefirst course i payed for and unfortunately the worst expierience lack of content beyond the stuff in the available simple swift tutorial andfrom an eduucational pint of view afwully if at all preparedits a shame that i can not give this course zero star which it deserves i should have checked the very negative feedback of the former participant before bying iti will be much much more alert regarding content on coursera from now on,1
809,worst course i took on coursera so far it wa my first course i actually paid for and it turned out to be the least useful one the small number of exercise and video doe not justify the high price of the course it might have been ok if they had included the io part also but charging eur for the first part alone is grossly overpriced,1
810,certainly not a beginner course you needed to have a good programming knowledge to make any sense of this course the final assignment asked you to do thing you hadn t been taught a i hadn t done any programming for year i certainly found this difficult fell behind and there isn t really anyone there to help almost asked for a refund but decided to try to continue i m struggling to motivate myself into the second course i really hope it s better than the first one,1
811,it s not a university standard course it s more like introduction to introduction diy swift the video are chaotic and lack explication example exercise and practical assignment much better intro to swift can be found on many youtube channel or just on swift documentation website,1
812,the initial lesson were rather chaotic the idea wa good but the execution wa not really good the significantly improved the quality for the second course so i assume that for a new iteration the it will be better too,1
813,huge gap between video and final assignment video should be edited we are not interested in trial and error of the instructor,1
814,this course is a rare example of how it s not done presentation is unstructured seems to be a student project where his professor help along to check certain topic the student ha to include to get a good grade,1
815,course wa the worst i have taken on coursera i wish i could have received a refund the professor were hard to follow laughed through mistake and did not do a good job of walking through the course content i would not recommend this course to anyone,1
816,please avoid to take this course lesson seems to be at least not prepared by the teacher,1
817,unfortunately the course is not very well thought out the lecture video are poorly organized concept are not presented in the proper context and lack sufficient detail depth little thought or effort wa put into designing the example in the video there are no actual coding exercise until the last week there are no example of elegant code nor thoughtful example of good v bad code the quiz contain question that are poorly worded and ambiguous and i think some actually have the wrong answer and are contradicted by other online resource it s very high level and they hand wave important concept i really don t see how this class can actually teach you to build a robust high quality app you re probably better off just reading some of the official documentation online,1
818,not well prepared course,1
819,after of the work completed i have to admit that this course is not good the instructor is not actually the professor himself and they do lot of mistake in the video you do not learn anything that helpful and perhaps the actual swift documentation is way more clearer than this course is,1
820,the course seemed not to be prepared with anticipation i left it because of that,1
821,no star for this course module i did and i think is not a valuable course give a bad introduction to the language there are inconsistency in the theory and knowledge of the language the preparation of the course is poor there is no direction a lot of error using playground and the instructor hesitate and doubt all the time during the recording of the screen that s not good point for the prestigious university of toronto and coursera one star for the review is too much no preparation lack of security bad quality,1
822,i wish i had paid closer attention to the refund policy the production quality and content did not meet my expectation,1
823,the instructor are not well prepared for the course the material are not well structured,1
824,sadly this course is not an introduction to swift programming a a beginner i found this course wa not structured and i wa confused about the correct step to take in order to start programming in swift no doubt that these guy are knowledgable but they do not plan the course or teach in a linear fashion furthermore the sound and video quality is poor and i have decided to quit this course after the first week and a half,1
825,very disorganized more than a course it seems more like student learning along with you the lesson have preparation and they come up with example that do not work half of the time during the video itself i do not recommend this course and a a matter of fact the entire specialization to anyone,1
826,i do appreciate the effort put into this course but a a programming course it is not very didactic it lack structure and even the name of class chosen for the example seem odd,1
827,poorly prepared course lectutets do not have enough qualified to teach others it s a shame to pay for this money i do not expect this from the university of toronto,1
828,i m sorry but the presentation were very poor and unprepared the first quiz focused on rather unimportant and stuff which wa not presented in video like keyboard shortcut etc do not recommend,1
829,first of all i expected something deeper first of all this courser is le understandable than the swift programming language free book from apple before i join the course i have read a few chapter and from my point of view book explains material much much better the second point it look like tutor invent example during the lesson on the fly this is bring a mess and last thing about this course that tutor commit an gross error during lecture please have a look at advanced swift lecture i am talking about closure the teacher said that closure capture the copy of outside variable but this is completely wrong closure capture the variable itself not the variable value,1
830,i am dropping the course suggestion one person talk to the audience rather than or talking to each other volume and pic quality poor it going too slowly just not enough meat to get me engaged esp if u compare to the course by paul hegarty stanford,1
831,each week is a very light overview of a topic there is little to no connection between the topic the course is not rigorous enough i felt at the end of the course i didn t learn anything,1
832,i feel like the lecture were short summary not actual college level lecture i really don t feel i learned anything,1
833,it s often not clear the point the professor of this course is trying to make instead he often seems to ramble pointing out a little question that a world designer might ask himself herself during the process without ever focusing on any the reader is left not knowing what the key take aways were,1
834,it s format need a good narrator not based on stupid commercial,1
835,well taught but not what i thought it would be,1
836,it s not worth the price,1
837,repetitive content like the latter course not challenging,1
838,this course is not worth taking especially if you have to pay for it it is boring and you hardly learn anything do not take this class it is not worth your money,1
839,the structure is not clear with similar idea coming up several time example can be far fetched britannica for ethical blindness the teacher read the script and sometimes stumble on the word an idea is explained in minute when s are enough i am getting bored and very disappointed because it is a very important topic these day i quit thank you anyways,1
840,very disappointing too much emphasis on mathematical notation where are the practical application lack of example it seemed more of a prose than a lecture would not recommend to a beginner period,1
841,cover basic statistic mean variance simple z and t test not what i wa expecting a inference multiple testing of data is a sign of poor experimental design and should be avoided not adjusted for bootstrapping is not a new idea and ha been used in other field,1
842,i ve not found this course organized pedagogically speaking the organization insofar a here is a list of stuff i ll be teaching make sense but a lot of the teaching is ill suited for someone looking to learn with a minimal statistical background it s incredibly frustrating and disheartening,1
843,the only reason for enrolling is to complete the data science specialization though it may make you reconsider continuing with it the instructor and provided material fail to adequately explain the concept this course is supposed to cover and do not prepare student for the quiz or assignment if you don t know statistic you won t learn it here if you know statistic you don t need this course,1
844,there are better free course out there to learn basic inferential statistic khan academy is a great place to start and udacity ha a great class that give a good intuitive understanding the main reason to take this class is if you are trying to finish the entire data science program otherwise look elsewhere for an intro stats class the instructor clearly know the material the class just doe not do a good job of transfering that knowledge,1
845,personally i feel that the way of sharing and teaching wa assuming everyone is an expert in this subject this course need to be reviewed to make it more suitable to various group of profession a not everyone ha the same level of mathematics background,1
846,the worst course i ve ever taken bad sound quality dead discussion forum not possible to understand material without external not mentioned in the course source,1
847,the course is very difficult to comprehend moreover the examplanations given ar not concise and brief,1
848,this course is very difficult to follow not because the topic are hard or too technical but mostly due to lecturer s poor job in explaining and creating a narrative,1
849,content covered in this course wa hard to learn both because it wa pitched at a level that realistically wa more akin to a wrap up of content already covered when in fact it wa all new content and because the instructor brian caffo ha not a style that wa conducive to teaching the instructor often would launch into a topic and then speed through a calculation with basically no explanation in term of time this wa one of the most intensive course in the specialisation and i d recommend taking this course alone not concurrently with other course for that very reason,1
850,poor course saturated with an instructer that us big word and doe not explain many difficult idea and take for granted that the leaner know a lot of probability and statistic,1
851,many video lacked associated pdf slide so confusing to watch some topic on slide were not covered in video a supplemental video for those would be great even of optional brian cato is a good presenter however more example needed to be done showing how to work out various statistical problem both by traditional method and using r,1
852,the worst professor in this specialization the subject really interesting and i have been studying for a while in my master s and phd in engineering so i could understand the bulk of the course this is a very important subject in data analysis and these poor explained class could make lot of people give up the specialization statistic involves much of mathematics and calculus which make it a natural challenge for most of the people please improve these class in order not to disappoint the student who want to become data scientist,1
853,this course which is part of data science specialization course which is a beginner specialization doesn t explain a it should to beginner they try to explain complex topic in minute if i didn t need the certificate i would definitely not waste my time on this course youtube video from khan academy or brandon foltz statistic are much more valuable you really get the topic and they are free the professor didn t want to spend time preparing good material from my point of view the preparation is very poor the course is more oriented to teach you to be a data monkey you know the code you need to write but you don t get what are you doing where do these formula come from,1
854,seeking out supplemental material is not only helpful but necessary this course doe not provide a foundation of knowledge for inferential statistic so much a present several equation and function and describe how one might use them,1
855,explanation not clear and feel like he s reading rather than explaining thing consecutive video feel like they are disconnected video stop in the middle of him talking something thank god for the swirl assignment which make thing much clearer also the course proceed very fast not giving enough time to the concept,1
856,get ready for a lot of frustration and independent research for being able to complete the course on continuous delivery the video of the course are not a great help,1
857,not on topic not honest and dogmatic also the auto email continue after unsubscribing from the course,1
858,sorry but the variable peer review ruined this course for me i either did not get enough review or a prankster would down mark for whatever reason they had in their head at that particular moment the staff don t seem interested in this a a problem and there is no way to rate a bad reviewer so they get away with it the other course in the specialisation are great but this one give very little in the way of tuition and relies on the whole on peer which for me didn t work out too well,1
859,started in middle of everything it course cover to factor sample in the final exam the minimum factor is or more you not will learn r not really business insight but you learn some specific case i think you will learn lot of better course in this site,1
860,much trivial content but advertised a an expert course further the assignment did not work properly at the beginning and there is no timely response of staff i would not waste money on that course again and will probably try to get refund in time,1
861,it said it could be done on your schedule but that is not true i want to withdraw from this stupid course it suck,1
862,the distribution were not well explained it could have been handled in a much better way,1
863,the entire course wa not paced well the capstone had a much work each week a the other course had in the entire week course to make it worse for me the capstone came up at the end of the year when teacher are overloaded already i ended up having to roll over to the next session way through work should have been better spread out i also do not like that you get no real teacher evaluation in a capstone meaning a student could take a full course over a year and then fail when the teacher finally look at all the work in the second capstone,1
864,need more understandable subtitle peer review for this course is not a good idea a well given abstract concept and different language,1
865,the course focus more on the theoretical side with no practical example it also doe not explain these theoretical concept in detail enough it wa difficult for me a a new learner in the text analytics field to follow such dense theoretical concept,1
866,this review is for coursera why you want me to click time to submit a review on home screen when i click on star to review new window open this is not a great ux please reduce no of click that a user ha to make to submit the review,1
867,this course doe not say anything about digitization which is the core subject of the digital wave,1
868,while there is some interesting content particuarly in the last week on design thinking some of the course topic don t seem to hold together well and the video include a lot of monotonous talking head while this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the video without consistently watching the interview question asked of speaker are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally if you re not watching you miss the question i would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for d printing with other application interspersed a example rather than constituting the lion s share of the course i believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skill with more opportunity for practice,1
869,week and were not satisfactory according to me the video lecture were difficult to comprehend week wa very good,1
870,course wa not easy to grasp lost interest after the first week and i barely got through the quiz at the end,1
871,while i enjoyed this course and the topic covered i don t feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it wa supposed to i enrolled in the business analytics specialization course with a focus on analyzing a business from the inside not outside of the week of the course i d say that only week wa valid from an internal perspective but it wa kept very high level i d say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis but not a advertised i also found the cartoon classroom question to be very annoying almost a bad a fingernail on a blackboard,1
872,so far the course is just a tutorial for using scratch and they re not teaching how to program that is the name of the course,1
873,the male professor seem to speak chinese half the time therefore not being able to understand the material for student who aren t fluent in chinese i prefer the female professor from advanced neurobiology i who presented the material in english and in an engaging and coherent way,1
874,the course content is great but peer evaluation is simply useless and almost random this specialisation need to introduce an actual final assessment by an actual expert not peer,1
875,while the task of summing up a lot of information in a minimum sized presentation is always a very difficult task the structure of the material presented wa not optimal this in turn made it difficult for me personally to actually connect the weekly information presented with the overall meaning and the objective of each module the why and how of most module fit to the meaning we are forming up to week the point i am leaving this class is not evident last some of the question contained ambiguity that could not be reasonably clarified even going back and reviewing the material of the specific segment thank you for the offered class in any case,1
876,it is not very advanced,1
877,the professor is reading long text it is not really attractive,1
878,i greatly enjoyed the material presented in this course and while i do not doubt the proficiency of it s creator the poor standard of spoken english of it two main presenter prevents me from recommending it to colleague a another reviewer ha remarked their english may be quite sufficient for day to day use with other expert but for inadequate for teaching student who are hearing many technical term for the first time the transcript are no better and also contain many mistake i believe that this course should be stopped until these problem are corrected,1
879,course wa to easy and nothing new in it not a the description that it ha algorithm time faster than google,1
880,i do not think that student should need to pay for a course in order to watch interview with previous graduate half of this course should have been condensed or excluded there is not much to learn in these module it wa decent but it wa not a five star course i think the rating on this are misleading,1
881,i really did not like the portion that went into detail about business analytics and related career path not a technical skill or ne,1
882,poor performance of jupyter and the wildly underestimated time commitment really sunk this one for me the latter especially is inexcusable the syllabus is lopsided and while organized not enough thought ha been given to the exercise workload,1
883,there s a lot of great information in this course and it s presented in a very good way however like the excel course in this specialization most of the material isn t about using tableau week is about running a project week are about using tableau and the final week are about presentation if you re interest isn t mainly in tableau i would recommend the course however if you re taking this course to learn tableau i would suggest not paying for it,1
884,the course is a bit outdated and i am finding it hard to stay motivated knowing there are other more recent course the topic i think are still relevant but the tool are not i am looking for course where there is hand on development that you follow with the instructor and i did not find this here,1
885,a basic course but not for the one who don t know anything about java or android not made for the beginner also the submitting project work is complicated and should be made more easier not recommended for the starter,1
886,mini project grade system is awful btw you have to wait till three student review you project one more point is that the content of video are not that enough you can just read the required textbook to get all knowledge and example,1
887,many of the problem set ask you to apply theorem in way that have not been demonstrated if a student make a mistake no feedback is given other than that is not the right answer,1
888,this course wa too messy i spent of my time to get the example to work it would have been better if after each module all the j and html file would be given in total not just the snippet,1
889,can not believe charge me homework,1
890,angular not angular which is disappointing but worse still it teach use of scope which is no longer recommended by the angular team themselves could be vastly improved by using modern angular best practice such a controller a syntax and teaching you to write code that is more compatible with angular,1
891,wa very difficult to follow this is a complex subject and the prof is trying his best but there are time the explanation is not sufficient instruction for installing gulp wa not good i wa unable to complete the following exercise after gulp installation failed instruction need to be short and crisp building on top of each other project ha it negative there must be solution at the end or at least a check point where you can start clean for the next project,1
892,this course cover the basic ground about approximation algorithm and would be very valuable for a practitioner but seems designed for people who already know the material and is more theoretical than applied lecture are very abstract with a description of the problem and a formal description of the solution there are few example with step by step tracing of algorithm that is how the algorithm actually work to solve the problem and a significant amount of expertise is assumed so much so that you wouldn t need this course for example there are question about approximation ratio but it is not explained this seems like something that is inherent to approximation algorithm but is only asked in the exam project and is not even mentioned in the lecture similar issue abound around the course,1
893,the course is really way to easy it could be done all in one day definitely not worth,1
894,i have not been satisfied with the theoretical content,1
895,lacking in content the oop portion of the final project wa poorly constructed the instruction were unclear and the exercise seemed futile we took a data set and further complicated it by abstracting into various object class i think a better example could be used since there are already plenty of way to do the thing our object were tasked with it seemed like a futile exercise i think a different type of real world object should be used perhaps one that is not easily stored in a data frame,1
896,this course touch many interesing aspect about r programming but i did not like the structure it doe not seem to me that it adequates it difficulty coming from the r programming enviornment also i miss some swirl lesson for many of the reading from the book there are not too many help from the mentor and the peer assigment in week took me too much time and had to consult a lot of external resource reading in general are ok but too simple i have learnt many thing but,1
897,all theory quiz you were left with the task of answering question based on model never seen or explained spent most time trying to make sense of them final project is almost a joke to try and decipher how to create from scratch based on the one they provided in the quiz it not a joke but it is very difficult when the actual excel and model making isnt part of the lecture,1
898,course did not meet any of the expectation neither excel nor the analysis part should have focused on one of the aspect to make it more stronger in my opinion deviated stressed too much on statistic and model building regression logistic regression etc but did not do justice to that also,1
899,i m here learning excel skill but this course especially week doe not teach excel skill,1
900,this course is only supported by a course of data analytics it should clearly state that advanced statistic is a prerequisite knowledge i expected to learn advanced excel technique not to be required to know statistic model to apply,1
901,this course wa tough but i dont mind a challenge but what i found frustrating about this course wa that first the quiz were often inconsistent with the lecture material the ta s were le helpful than my fellow classmate without whom i would not have made it through the course and the final wa an immense challenge that took over my life for about week despite the calculation by the instructor that it would take hour i did give it a few star because i honestly did learn thing i did not know and i understand the value of the application of what wa taught for modern business i have been informed that the course is being reviewed by the instructor for strengthening and i agree with that direction,1
902,the title is misleading this course ha a little to do with excel you could get some mathematical information but i do not think you will master anything,1
903,i found week binary classification really confusing it wa just not clear specific were not given definition were not given poorly instructed,1
904,this class required far too much independent study the instructor did not provide enough instruction or reading material to complete the quiz each week there wa too much focus on the conceptual data with very little emphasis on practical application of the material,1
905,i am sorry to say this but the tutorial could have been organzied in a much more serious way i do not know how much time the professor have put on preparation but it give me a sloppy impression the class carry the name of university of duke and euro are charged so i think the learner would reasonably expect to see that the teacher put lot of time to organize the course structure in order to efficiently give a much a information to the learner within limited time for example i believe nobody would not say that the week content on confusion matrix is very consistently explained and this is just one example,1
906,this course is doable if you have prior knowledge of probability and statistic this is not for beginner and should therefore by reclassified a intermediate and above i am sorry i enrolled in this course i have truly hit a brick wall and can go no further,1
907,this is definitely not a course for beginner,1
908,doe not teach excel very well while tryng to apply the basic usage instruction to not too difficult problem the ability to interface with excel after some knowledge of python r or other programming language would be helpful in the data science programming that is increasingly being promoted,1
909,to course got tougher every week while the lecture video is not cover everything,1
910,the content of the course wa good however i did not like the presentation of the material moreover such a topic would need to be covered by a longer duration course,1
911,i expected far more handy real life excel example not to see a teacher speaking and writing stat formula for hour the idea of this course is very good it ha some room for improvement,1
912,the lecture video are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking you need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand just study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project in fact you need peer help or to read more material to fully understand and finish the project the quiz compared to what is asked in the project is too simple and thus not constructive enough in the overall learning overall i would recommend you to have a solid background before proceed with this course if you want to improve your learning experience,1
913,this course is mostly theory based and certainly not what i am expected,1
914,content not discussed in proper detail instructor skim over the concept it difficult to follow,1
915,much work need to be done on this course to make it friendly to learner the quiz and assignment do not align with what is taught in the lesson further the content in the lesson doe not even show or explain what is expected from the learning i spent the majority of my time exploring the discussion to discover what i wa supposed to be doing and the rest of it on google teaching myself the concept that were not taught in the course,1
916,the material is sort of interesting but there is not much hand holding i actually am an excel beginner and have merely an average grasp of mathematics before signing up i read the prerequisite there were none it is advertised a a class for beginner but i have found it beyond frustrating and whats more i pre paid for the specialization so this excel class and the final project seem to be an utter waste of money without me going off to study excel at length before trying the course again why not label it a an intermediate or higher class i feel there should be a more obvious indication of the difficulty,1
917,it ha a lot of problem including not so many lecture about excel itself most of the time you will be watching video about statistic method the lecture are very superficial even though the quiz and project demand a lot of knowledge and time the course seems to have a staff of one man the professor of the course rarely reply even though he did at the beginning of the session and all the work seems to be done by his assistant who try his best but end up not coping with all the question asked at the discussion forum,1
918,way too many abstract concept that are not relevant to the challenge that i encounter in my day to day role i wish this course would actually show me how to solve practical business problem the nd part of the course is not enjoyable at all sorry,1
919,the course name is very misleading while overall it is not a bad course i believe a lot of people come here expecting very different material let s just put it this way mastering data analysis mostly thing to do with probability with occasional use of excel do not expect to learn anything new in excel,1
920,the transition is from easy to advanced it get really confusing not sure if it s just me i am not following the lesson anymore so i left the course,1
921,interesting content but not well presented faculty read the script and struggled with pronunciation fluency and generally engaging presentation combination of basic content on the one hand and highly specialised information terminology without explanation on the other wa not helpful to learning,1
922,this is a very basic course that introduces you to the topic but doesn t go into much depth while it s clear that a lot of time wa spent filming and creating the course material i still would not recommend this course both the presentation itself and the in video quiz are unbelievably obnoxious the presenter emphasizes every other word and talk in a very unnatural manner that make it very tiring to listen to and the in video quiz are far too basic and take up too much time sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activity which are badly designed and just frustrating overall i recommend waiting for a better course,1
923,not very helpful in the homework i spent more time wrestling with command in r than actually gaining an understanding of the subject matter also i really didn t need so many subject matter example about the professor s baby s pooping habit and my family is dutch with all the offensive humor that come with it so it s not just a matter of the sense of humor not translating i m re taking statistic with calculus online at my local state university and frankly i can t notice any benefit from taking this course first my current online statistic with calculus course is rewarding and i feel like i m truly gaining mastery of the topic whereas in the basic statistic course i wa floundering the graphic in the way the lesson are presented are well done but i would have been just fine with fewer graphic if it meant more worked through example,1
924,the lecturer doe not clearly explain the topic very well especially on the topic in probability and distribution his presentation in english is honestly quite hard to understand,1
925,the professor know what they are doing but not good at making the concept plain to the student who don t have the strong background most of the time i would just ask myself why they did this and that but later they don t provide enough explanation,1
926,mismatch between assessment and course content after not being able to pas the assessment i ve fallen behind on the course and i m too busy to catch up,1
927,this course cover a good amount of bayesian statistic however the presentation video starting from week really suck they change instructor for difference topic and obviously some instructor are not very good at explaining other than reading the material the video skipped many medium step that are actually very crucial for understanding the concept and no suggested reading material at all either also the quiz are not very well designed either for example some quiz are much more simpler than the course material which make it not helpful at all to understand the course material itself while some time it is the opposite the first three course in this specialization are very good but somehow this course are way below the quality of the previous one,1
928,the instructor kept referring to different author and book a if she wasn t sure what she wa saying wa true she wa just reading off a screen and not actually teaching might have been easier and a bit more beneficial to just read a well prepared set of slide on my own the first set of quiz question also weren t really relevant to what wa in the actual lesson quite disappointed in this part of the specialization a the other section had in depth presentation clear information lot of example and great slide,1
929,the programming exercise should not be optional i still intend to do them but now i passed the course with a mark but only of knowledge,1
930,the video and explanation are very poor most of the time the instructor are reading off a script and everything feel fake by reading off a script they are forced to hand wave and do not explain concept covered completely the only thing i liked about this course were the problem set which were interesting to do will not buy rest of specialization feel like this is just a cash cow for ucsd,1
931,feedback in assignment is not good enough for example for the point and segment there are no correct answer in output a a reference,1
932,it wa really boring just reading the text in the presentation it can be made in class not,1
933,informative but not challenging enough,1
934,i have given you a star rating a on finishing my course promptly all the information i submitted ha suddenly been locked i haven t been able to answer a classmate s request to review his work worse i haven t been able to print off my own work for reference this is a real project so i need to be able to do this we were not given notice that this would happen disappointed,1
935,discussion in this course are voiceless and dead and the instructor never appears in discussion i couldn t understand anything from video lecture can not understand enunciation not enough detailed lack of example related to the assignment so the only source wa repository with html file and a lot of searching through bioconductor forum i liked the relevance of quiz question to real life genomic question but all quiz question were outstandingly difficult because of both lack of example in lecture and error in some package inside bioconductor overall i expected much more from this course and i can not recommend it to anyone,1
936,interesting topic and some good information presented on a variety of issue for many animal and situation however presented info is often vague and generalized some section discus very little scientific data to back up claim made and course is generally not very rigorous or challenging,1
937,the course is uneven at best with some module providing insight and knowledge and others not so much the presentation in some of the module is perhaps an example of how not to do it reading fro a script in a monotonous voice some of the material like the lengthy historical review of edinburgh s vet school might be good advertising and interesting but doe not fall under the scope of what it take to be a vet good idea but with a few exception le than average execution,1
938,this course feel a lot like it s being taught by a non teaching professor the lecture are very long not chunked for easy viewing to the point where i couldn t download to my phone for offline off wifi use there are very long locally hosted reading so they re hard to print and you can t add them to an offline reader app and the reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography rather than actual reading assignment because there are no link and some refer to selection without giving page number or in at least one case a multi volume book the information is comprehensive and very valuable but the delivery is very lacking a a mooc,1
939,simply not a engrossing a i had hoped it would be,1
940,i am afraid this is only two star from me for now it is a course with great content and a lot of potential but the way how it is delivered can be greatly improved to make it easier to understand and more engaging i just hope the team do not give up but improve this to be one of the best course on coursera it can well be,1
941,speaker sound so monotone and dry that they leave an unenthusiastic impression of an incredibly fascinating subject some video lecture and writing are so unnecessarily verbose they cloud what is being taught frustratingly fought my way through the lesson and failed to clearly retain what i wa trying to learn from prof germano all apology to the professor for any harshness and i may try again one day but not now,1
942,i don t feel this course is always very clear i feel that i usually am missing the big picture i follow it in detail but the pace doe not match in term of how you can view the big picture of it,1
943,the course content wa not very appealing explanation were not that engaging what i really missed wa the actual practical aspect where you don t work with command prompt but an much more user friendly interface that is more up to date with current standard,1
944,too high level last assignment too ambiguous peer assessment wa completely random and not reliable to pas the course,1
945,the course a material are interesting and with significant value same comment on the teacher this would be perfect if the third party the vm is working fine i can t say i m happy about the course where the frustration is probably the right word describing my feeling right now wish me luck for this week i might pas might not,1
946,a lot of the lecture material is unclear and doe not fit with the content i ve learned from other bi book lecture and experience additionally the quiz don t seem to test for real world bi knowledge rather they test for the ability to interpret the instructor fairly unique view on some bi topic furthermore the additional reading need to be culled significantly it look like someone just googled bi topic and then copy and pasted the link they found please prioritize the additional reading highest value to lowest value and then post only the to reading that rank the highest a pairwise comparison process may be useful when doing this,1
947,if you aren t familiar with cooking and nutrition this course is a good fit however if you have a bit of background in healthy eating you may not get a much out of this course,1
948,it wa too simple for my taste and not very fullfilling science wise,1
949,condescending not backed up with evidence and preachy somewhere in there are some good idea for making healthy food for kid but given i m probably of similar politics to what they re pushing and i found it obnoxious i think they re alienating a lot of people must do better,1
950,the concept are good but the delivery is quite dry very hard to pas the quiz a there are no analogy or example in the video just theory i did not enjoy this course a much a i did the first two in the programme,1
951,not good enough,1
952,it cover theoretical part of what big data is and basic info about hadoop quality of presentation slide is below average most of them are not readable many font many color some with complicated picture some with no information at all part with map reduce is just slightly touched not explained in detail without example practical task from hadoop are very easy and they show nothing just how to navigate over hadoop file system,1
953,the content of the course is ok the main problem is that the way the information is presented ilkay altintas who is the main lecturer is a sweet woman but lecturing from a manuscript is not her strongest side it is clear that she is reading from a screen while she is looking into the camera anyone could do that job and they should have chosen more of an news anchor type of person with better pronunciation and more flow it s simply very uninspiring and boring to listen to also dollar is far too expensive for such a short course,1
954,too basic knowledge not enough information about targeted therapy everything is explained without going into any detail,1
955,test error no answer from staff on forum poor narration at time audio script that do not quite correspond to what is being said it need careful reviewing and more user friendly feature being introduced by the organiser,1
956,i am very sorry to say that the course is very poor in english speaking too bad you do not teach the course in french this could be useful for a lot of french speaking student and better for the quality of the course,1
957,the instructor s explanation is not orderly nor structured and with a lot of noise,1
958,too much time required the first quiz had almost nothing covered in the video lecture i saved all transcript and wa unable to answer the question the sim s i have never seen anything like that and again it most certainly wasn t covered in the lecture disappointed in this course it took hour for each segment of the first week not to a wa stated leaving this course,1
959,course lecture don t seem to match up with the question on the quiz it is also not clear if the typed in answer are not read by the program correctly or if the answer do not match what the instructor is looking for in any case the week quiz is very difficult to figure out,1
960,the course is not for beginner and winform lover this is real re branding yourself i would say path to reborn to what real open source world is living in low or no help from course instructor community or google course come in huge amount of concentrated video hardest assignment i would give up on the beginning but commitment is top of all i respect anyone who ha completed,1
961,the subtitle were bad not in sync with the word of the professor and were wrong in many case delivery of lecture and visuals of the lecture wa ok module were very confusing and not interestingthank you professor for your time and effort,1
962,the touch on a lot of topic but do not provide nearly enough information to make it worth staying through the course,1
963,the way the content is delivered is not interesting and the lecturer basically is reading from the power point,1
964,i m not sure if the material presented in this course warranted a whole separate course even if it only wa one week it probably could have been inserted in various segment of a larger data science specialization throughout the class most of the topic discussed should be common knowledge to a mid level manager of data science or even strategic marketing in general,1
965,in my opinion this course doe not fit to the specialization well not sure how big proportion of the specialization student have a background different from data science and are going to manage the data science team,1
966,not a good a the others and way too quick,1
967,the course cover very useful and interesting topic not in very much detail though it is useful to begin with the topic but it is really not more that a thin introduction,1
968,aimed at those needing to get service in a spectrum of family living too much on california system not enough on direct coping with day to day,1
969,lot of overlap in the video not a lot of information on c feature too few hand on activity with the feature taught,1
970,assumption about the student are not clear before starting the course instructor example are not practical in all context jump to dijkstra in very second week without clarity on major c concept and example is too much an expectation from the student switching from c to c for the first time confusion with deadline for assignment too many lecture during later week course a if the effort is to crunch everything in that week and complete the course if it spaced properly with example and problem over few more week it would help,1
971,the instructor speaks too slow teaching concept that are not valid anymore e g prefer inline over function call const v define declaring variable anywhere in the code etc the topic are too small and too much time is devoted to them,1
972,quiz are trivial make the certification worthless prof campbell is not a good lecturer the topic are treated mostly superficially then suddenly go into too much detail sometimes how to use intellij idea machine learning subtitle are very buggy i enjoyed mr farivar s talk much more it seems like he know what he is talking about and his presentation are well structured,1
973,the course brings lot of information but the assessment are not at all creative so it becomes a lot of theory with little practice el curso trae mucha informaci n pero la actividades no son n un poco creativas entonces se converte en mucha teoria con poca practica,1
974,not very much in depth and doe not offer complete lecture note which are necessary for answering the quiz,1
975,if you already know everything about the topic and just forgot some little thing or you are very strong in calculus this may be a nice refresher otherwise not very useful really dense and little explanation i liked the youtube mit course on probability it includes bayesian statistic much more since it ha good explanation of the concept,1
976,this course wa a very disappointing experience since it is designed around depending on peer reviewed assignment that don t get graded i have been waiting for over month for the st assignment to get regraded in the future i suggest the creator of this course stay away from peer graded assignment a it put student in a position where their grade depends on others and not the knowledge the student acquires from the course content,1
977,interesting concept however in my opinion there is sometimes a lack of practice especially for the coding part entire course are exclusively theoretical explanation during the course i have heard several time this sentence don t ask me why which is disappointing in my learner experience and frustrating not to get the answer i wa expecting subject mastering the teacher seems to be lost sometimes and admits not being able to explain some part of the course which may confuse and demotivate learner not knowing exactly what they are being teached and how it work moreover in the course covering database subject security issue are involved example week c video how to send a roar from the app to the internet,1
978,this course is very easy to learn all it s theme are so good explained i m sorry but i might to change the rate of this course all went well until the course started reading the explanation of code after that i lost and i could not continue because it just came out of nowhere coding there wasn t a previous step that say we will encode here or are we going to do this somewhere just appeared and disappeared a it appeared we were very well but i can not say much more,1
979,lecture were extremely good but assignment and grader were very low quality and difficult to decipher requirement from professor and ta were not active in the forum,1
980,unnecessary video segment at the start of each lecture is annoying and a total waste of time the content of the course lack in substance compared to the an introduction to american law course so much time spent on european effect on british law this is not a course for lawyer i would presume but supposed to be an introduction,1
981,i did not meet my expectation from the course,1
982,the idea of having support with the video doe not work with this course also the exam do not match at all with the information provided the anwers to the exam are so relative or subjective and that s a problem for those who doe not domain english very well just like me,1
983,a lot of reading material is unavailable link doe not work or it is behind paywall i also found the video lacking for example there were important tip and only one wa given before jumping at next topic,1
984,i expected much more information in video instead of that video are very short and provide only few information and don t allow u to pas the exam at the end of each module there are some link to website where you can learn much more and which are not even written by the professor,1
985,a nice entry level course lacking a forum discussion wa not even able to report some issue with video and no explanation provided with quiz result,1
986,not so much live example full of theory this ha been thought in class it self,1
987,overall this course doe have some good content and delivers big data concept however a others have mentioned some content especially in early module could either be combined or ommited key focus area on spark and mongodb are not given enough focus and lab time the quiz have badly worded question finally the last assignment required to pas the class ha bad direction and cover content not reviewed in the class spent a frustrating amount of time trying to get what most likely is simple code to work i m hoping this particular module is revised for those just interested in learning spark or mongo and not doing the certificate program you can probably get better learning from doing your own research,1
988,week were worthwhile week were very thin not really up to expectation based on first course or even first two week,1
989,if there hadn t been so many hiccup with the video and quiz i would recommend this course however i lost a great deal of time viewing incomplete video and trying to complete quiz covering material that wa not addressed or only partially addressed in the video then had to go back and review all the video once they had been re uploaded it wa a very frustrating experience i lost momentum and even motivation and a a result am now behind with the assignment and quiz,1
990,i had really high expectation from the course i believe but it wasn t upto the mark all it went through wa some basic though i would have expected to go in detail esp for aperture shutter and dof i am not sure if that i going to be covered in next unit but having gone though the basic in st unit that wa expectation in nd unit,1
991,machine learning is too simplified and spark part is not even explained also very little relation of all course with big data,1
992,too short lecture the study material is not properly defined only entire book to read a reference the task test are all literal part of the book to complete no understanding of the subject is motivated but memorizing and tiring reading of book without proper direction,1
993,this is the poorest coursera course i have participated in very few and short videoes that only scratch the surface of cybersecurity instead you are directed to massive amount of reading with no guidance on what should be read to read it all includes sometimes page for one week not going to happen i ended up just reading the introduction glancing through the text and searching for the answer for the quiz this course totally miss the purpose and potential of moocs and the great coursera platform it s a shame,1
994,poorly made very short video that do not explain the subject matter some of the content is outdated,1
995,the course is for an overview of many aspect of cybersecurity there are many resource to read video that briefly discus concept of the week then there are quiz and discussion with the topic of the week doing the possibility at the student to talk about that and post his idea for assimilate concept and reaching goal of the course this is useful also for discus with other student and how your idea is viewed i think there is a very basic course in his entire length with more reading lecture at academic or professional level not for a beginner it can be adding video with more length and in depth that in a easy way the ten domain about cybersecurity,1
996,this course is not prepared a well you see several video with animated presentation and typical vocabulary term it is not for beginner because in course you didn t find answer it is not for pro because in course you didn t find interesting material hope that instructor can change course to better,1
997,could have utilized video lecture more question on final exam did not seem to relate to material covered in course course seems to just comprise or minute long video lecture and then direct student to vast amount of online reading material,1
998,video seemed disjointed assignment were marked inconsistently did not find the subject interesting but the course did give useful insight into the industry,1
999,pretty average and way too short fast paced video felt like it wa put together on the fly i don t usually review but this wa not great the reading material they linked to wa the best content overall,1
1000,the video and document are not balanced with the quiz the quiz question are sometimes verbatim sentence from one book with a missing word which i find hardly a test of acquired knowledge the course must rise above only a few definition and rough concept most of the video s hardly offer insight they last only minute and cover a few of those definition this course ha a lot of potential but in it current format and content it wa a disappointment,1
1001,this required a lot of work with little gained some question referring to budget and site layout required skill that weren t learned in the course the word feedback comment i got from all reviewer did not feel like worthy response to the amount of time i put into this project additionally i wa graded negatively by some reviewer without reason a happened in other section overall not really worth the money for a paid certificate would be nice if maybe for the capstone only some sort of professional or professor weighed in on your project for some legitimate and helpful critique,1
1002,pro effort ha been taken in putting up the assignment con quality of teaching is very poor and too fast to follow through instructor have rushed to present course material i would not recommend this course princeton and stanford offer much higher quality and presentation on the same topic,1
1003,too prescriptive and prone to list do these thing when editing a novel if that s what i wa looking for i could search the web for blog maybe this wa too beginner focused for me but i m not sure i learned anything really useful here,1
1004,felt very much like an exercise in writing by number assignment instruction were too vague and the pas fail grading system meant lot of classmate were upset that their work wa not appreciated or understood so many people on the course do not have english a a first language that the marking is often erratic great that non native speaker are trying to write in english enriching the canon but in those circumstance a pas fail system seems misguided,1
1005,i hope the instruction were cleary and not too vague that it wa open to many interpretation an example would have helped and the rubric criterion for grading should have been shown beforehand so student would be guided what point they would consider when making their piece,1
1006,the material isn t bad and it doe provide some interesting prompt to think and write about but the curriculum is not at all creative it focus on easily teachable and repeatable lesson that teach a certain standard way of doing thing it try to reduce creative writing down to a formula instead of acknowledging that many compelling and successful story can have almost any imaginable form if perhaps many type of structure had been emphasized or structure had been pointed out a optional this would have been mitigated but the time period is so short that there s no time the result is a class that feel more like writing how to make a formulaic sellable book than anything with creative in the title,1
1007,undoubtedly the course instructor is very knowledgeable however i did not take away a much from this course a i would like to it is mostly theoretical very limited example i also missed the bio in biostatistics a title like mathematical statistical theory boot camp would be better suited i believe having a set of case that get reused in some form over all lecture would be very beneficial for at lease mine understanding the topic the form of lecturing is not using the benefit that an online platform offer so instead of short interactive video this ha slide with lengthy essential spoken word with it hardly summary,1
1008,a very big difficulty for me french people who us to speak english everyday for may work is that teacher don t do any effort to speak slower and to articulate a with all other course i ve attended in english it s impossible to read a transcription even in english while reading slide slide are not sufficient by themselves i e without commentary beside the workaround i ve used is to print french translation or english transcription and read it trying to guess which part suited with which slide for a non free course it s not really professional,1
1009,this is really bad structured a analogy imagine a cookbook that say in chapter you ll learn how to cook pie but here in introduction let me tell you how to add baking powder in them it is not useless information it is just very out of place learning some git command wa the most usefull in the course for me though again why would you first show the command and just after that explain what s the tool for and where to download it and by the way it take half a day to cover all week material listened through all video installed the tool which is not bad just of other user information,1
1010,i mean it s replicated in the next class and it ha silly question in the practice quiz it s not worth it just kill this,1
1011,this wa really basic information it s not really a week course it take several hour the info is necessary but it s sufficient a a single week of content for a larger course,1
1012,there just wasn t much to this class it s not bad information but it could have been done in one week,1
1013,very very introductory i didn t find the tooling aspect of this course particularly helpful but i m not in the target audience it s length wa misleading i completed the work in two day easily but i am a technologist and already had the tool installed if you use github and rstudio the meat of the course is only about an hour of the lecture,1
1014,very shallow overview not really a full course i d say,1
1015,this course is not very beginner friendly,1
1016,the course is well structured and provides a good introduction however i expected a bit more from a course that cost pound than just a few clip on how to install and set up software create a github account etc this information is available for free online on the website of the respective software i understand that such an introduction is needed for the course but then do not offer it a a separate pound module instead include it for free with any other specialization you can buy,1
1017,this should not be a course of it own,1
1018,this should not be it own course a it would be pretty useless if you were doing it on it own without doing any of the other course the end of course project literally being just to make a github account and download r studio could be quickly covered in the first week of the other course,1
1019,you will learn some command line command git github and what you will need for eventually using r i wa a bit annoyed that this course is a requirement for the data science certification which is what i am after i already knew everything taught in this course and wa a bit annoyed i had to pay for this in order to complete the track i think course that are fully setup like this should be opt in not required,1
1020,the quiz are not set up correctly and you get marked wrong when you put in the correct answer it seems that the course wa rushed and not properly tested before it accepted student the content is good and that is why i gave it more than one star,1
1021,i am honestly not a fan of amy s teaching style she seems to have a discussion with herself about character building technique but not really explain the technique nor structure it for the student there are too many shop talk i would rather have a structure explained to me and then hear a discussion the way brando skyhorse doe in the plot course really a let down i will have to buy the book she keep averting i guess after spending quite good money on the course already pity,1
1022,i didn t find this course particularly helpful or useful i m not sure why there wa a disconnect somewhere i think maybe that i didn t receive the help that i feel i still need on the subject of how to create a great memorable believable character also some of the assignment were confusing nothing really stand out about this course and it wa actually a bit boring and i don t feel i learned anything related to the subject everything about this class need some work the video the instruction syllabus content and the assignment sorry i didn t like it,1
1023,i didn t think there were many solid pointer and not much that wa original coming from the instructor herself,1
1024,i wa looking for a course that discus how to think about the data and how to manipulate the data based on the question you have this course wa more basic and didn t really focus on the many way of visualizing the data to tell a story the course did not discus the pro and con of each type of visualization e g pie chart v line graph v column chart etc but of course more complex because we are using tableau with the type of question and answer you are looking for this type of content is what i wa most interested in,1
1025,the course is very preliminary it content can be covered in one session and doe not need week the assignment were not clear enough the course material can not be downloaded and can not be retrieved or used a reference after finishing the course unlike other course i have taken with coursera but in other university,1
1026,unsyncronize subtitle with audio please fix thisimo i think the video must not too long below minute video so lecturer separated it to more segment and give pop up quiz in video,1
1027,it s a bit too simple all of this there is not enough depth in the course no way i would give for such an introductory material the best part of the course are the additional resource list the good and bad example are useful a well but they are all too simple a well the video are good quality though and there is some information that is useful if you are looking for a simple introduction never seen an interview have no experience with public speaking have not taken many oral exam then this is for you i rate this at star because i wa expecting more a lot more mastering really more like not completely failing,1
1028,i am not sure peer review is eventually working in this course,1
1029,very theoretical and mathematical and not enough real example,1
1030,this isn t a beginner course i dropped out in first week i took every note i could and reviewed again and again i really think the instructor is an intelligent man but i m not quite sure he understands how to teach well i m really disappointed that i didn t get to take anything away from this class,1
1031,a really hard class for anyone not graduated from collage,1
1032,i probably should wait to finish this course before reviewing but i m halfway through and have found my motivation gone i m finishing it just to finish it the delivery add nothing to the content especially a much of it is simply the presenter reading list also shown on screen class content would better serve the student a a searchable pdf and why are there super specific question on quiz about thing like what specific funders require in a grant proposal that s information that you look up when you need it not that you quiz people on this class is a let down,1
1033,i could not finish because video were stuttered even with bigger bandwidth and a a consequence i could not finish the course and the exercise in my limited free time therefore only star is the problem solved now cause i d like to resume the course again if that s more successful now i would start the next part of the specialization thank you for an answer,1
1034,this is a complex course for people who don t know r studio while it is not very hard to learn r studio even for people who are not comfortable with coding it is very difficult when people get stuck i did not get the much needed support when my r studio installation failed or when installation of library failed with error message the instructor wa good course content is good but the lack of a suitable support representative for such complex subject pull down the reputation of this course please provide a good support personnel to at least help with online query,1
1035,hello unfortunately just my opinion not enough information about r test and program what is this basic detail for testing and code no detail for mac user video are to short to understand detail and goal what i will learn how to use mathematic formula if i could i wan na leave this course thanks for understanding,1
1036,again the content and presentation is great but the web site is getting really annoying especially in the assignment area the editor is faulty and on the submission on visualization you can not use visualization to make your point due to technical limitation can t paste chart or screenshots sometimes verification doe not work support is sometimes very good sometimes useless depends with whom you chat,1
1037,i am not impressed with this course so far the quiz and assignment are out of order with the material being presented the question on each come from reading and lecture content that have not been introduced to the audience at that particular point in the course the first module wa a very very basic outline of a generic analysis process and really ha nothing to do with digital marketing analytics in particular,1
1038,when going through the theory course i often wondered why the assignment are so abstract and theoretical and i thought that maybe when we come to practice we will be able to do something with our hand no way while reinforcing the theoretical background mostly repeating same postulate from the theory course this course contributes very little to it name practice only the last module on presenting go a little further than making you ponder on abstract theme this is surprising there are lot of practical tool discussed in the course and you have no opportunity to get hand on at least one of them except google trend and evaluate it at least for primitive purpose why doe the teacher not take the example of the brilliant aric rindfeisch s course marketing in the digital world with really well crafted practical assignment,1
1039,i appreciate this course and the instructor s time but so far i haven t really learned anything the structure of every lesson is here are the thing we re going to cover name not explain those thing here are the thing we covered i think there s a lot of potential for this course in the long run i would advise having a professor from illinois who is not in the business school take this course and get their feedback i believe the instructor is very smart and experienced in this area so this is definitely a course that could grow into a coursera essential,1
1040,incredibly frustrated by the peer grading system i ve been able to work on the course at relatively fast pace and have now completed all of the lecture reading quiz and test but can t go on to the next course because not enough people have submitted the homework for me to grade i understand the advantage of being able to learn from others but it doesn t outweigh the disadvantage of not being able to work at one s own pace,1
1041,the course is good but it doe not ha lecture slide that is better for student to understand,1
1042,i ll say the same about this class a the rest of the specialization if you have the skill to complete this course then you don t need to take this course if you don t have the skill to complete this course you will not complete this course the course instruction is at foot level and the assignment are very challenging and the course will not teach you the skill required to complete the assignment i recommend the machine learning course from bill s colleague at university of washington that is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignment though still very challenging,1
1043,this course probably deserves star in a better maintained form but the entire specialization is not maintained the lecture have no production value basically it s a money pit that coursera is keeping up cynically it s a real shame because the syllabus correctly address a gap in most data scientist skill,1
1044,the title is misleading since at scale led people to think that large scale data processing platform such a spark and nosql database will be central to the course right from the start the assignment need a lot of improvement i am not happy with how we re often only required to submit a single number a an answer the biggest problem is that this way the grader won t be able to give you meaningful feedback hint of where you might be wrong a grader that only tell you your answer is incorrect doe little to help you learn from mistake i think assignment can be paced differently now it feel that we have a bunch of very easy part a g that is not very interesting where the last three are significantly harder,1
1045,the exercise are fun and challenging however the lecture are not related to the exercise and are very hard to follow i think it s the same thing a brian s class in john hopkins data science course if you are taking bill howe s class just go straight to those exercise and skip lecture,1
1046,the grader is horrible leaving you with such brief error message you never know what is wrong with your code the forum is not a useful a i expected nor a it is in other coursera course you know few classmate the video provide you with ton of information but not much of them are well organized i often felt tired and confused since these long video seldom got to the point,1
1047,good focus on idea v principle the focus on relational algebra is a great way to look at data manipulation in general unfortunately relational algebra is explained quite well but not really applied after that this could be a great course if it really taught to constantly think in term of relational algebra okay ish explanation of database and hadoop not very deep and not always structured but rather focused on the technology principle instead of the data principle i think that this specialisation suffers the same problem most data science mining analytics course suffer it ignores the non technical starting point scientific or business relevance how doe one organise data get to know completely new data understand possible value i e how to start a data science project if all there is is unorganised data and the wish to do something with it,1
1048,very elementary take approximately hour to complete can not continue with the in dept material but have to wait until next week and payment ofcourse,1
1049,week doe not seem enough for a crash course,1
1050,very short quality of the course is also not that good,1
1051,too theoretical e g comparison between statistic and ml is not at all useful too many quiz after very short class and on topic of absolutely generic thing,1
1052,unfortunately this project is not fully aligned with all the previous program which is a shame ideally the project wa more related to quantitative data or have compulsory module npl it wa certainly a very important learning but very stressful to have to grasp npl and do the project in a short time learning npl in short time in a diy way without any help it wa very negative and stressful,1
1053,the explanation are not clear the course is very theoretical there s just one obligatory programming task it s one of the worst course i have ever enrolled in,1
1054,really disappointing the slide contain a lot of paper reference that seem to be of high quality that s the reason i m giving it star and not just but the course itself is bad it cover many algorithm but so superficially that you learn nothing and there are not enough programming assignment to really allow you to get any intuition on the concept i would love to see this be turned into a course week specialization in itself and the professor sure look like he ha the knowledge to fill these week but a a single course over week it s not good,1
1055,i really enjoyed the first two week when it came to javascript i couldn t follow so much information wa missing and lesson were not clear anymore i understand that the goal wa to teach the most in a short time but this wa not the right approach,1
1056,speaking of beginner level it is good until you are learning cs in it but a java script start this course becomes a headache not because javascript is difficult but they made it difficult instead of going with basic they teach you to manipulate image which is not every one s interest field they should improve their javascript course other than that it is ok,1
1057,all the module but last are really interesting and informative the last week s module is very poorly explained a beginner can not really understand it,1
1058,the course is a bit of a show maybe that s good for teenager and millennials but not for me,1
1059,i wa very disappointed in this course which held much promise too much of it ha to do with the changing of colour i got bogged down by hex colour requirement and other ancillary requirement i did not want to learn such thing i wanted to learn the methodology of programming and how the statement in html cs and javascript interact all of these area were only touched on in very minor way and with little learned i got more out of the book i borrowed from the library in the same timeframe,1
1060,okay for an intro not the most boring content it is a bit aweful that the insist on you using their library and programming environment you spend perhaps of your actually practicing coding and the rest is wasted in library you will never use again,1
1061,very very basic course learned about html cs in initial class then it wa completely javascript but there wa no detail about how to use javascript for web programming project and quiz are kind of ok difficulty i will recommend this course for the people who are not aware of programming,1
1062,very poor content on java script if you just started j do not take this course it will be too hard,1
1063,the lecturer are speaking very fast some time at the code practice it is not understandable how to solve the problem,1
1064,final assignment is too difficult to do for beginner it s crucial for them not to pas the course unless getting a certain score on the final assignment,1
1065,html and cs were great javascript wa very confusing a it did not teach me what each part of the code meant including the syntax and hence i wa unable to understand anything by week despite having listened to all the lecture and participated in the all the activity i wish javascript s structure wa more consistent with that of html and cs,1
1066,waaay too basic and simple for a comprehensive principle course one or two concept is not enough to gain an understanding the power behind online learning is that if it take you three view to understand it all you have the luxury please beef up the video and the assignment the assignment had no feedback mechanism so i could easily plow through them without any knowledge of whether i did them right,1
1067,this course is just definition and the next one a well i wa expecting a few more technical example or exercise mixed with their accompanying definition but i will check another course that is not so academic,1
1068,this course is very short i ve completed it in about hour nothing wa told about linear algebra statistic optimization it is not enough even to learn data science,1
1069,difficult content not explained well by the presenter,1
1070,i wa interested in this course but a it stand it is more like marketing hype than a proper course for one thing it try to cover far too much material in week within the limited scope of the beta test i started the node red stuff it look easy but the lecturer didn t make it clear what it wa for anyway a much more thorough introduction should have been given to everything the lecture on the rasberry pi were a joke in order to do the course within week i would have had to order a rasberry pi before getting to these lecture a clear guide to course prerequisite and the rasberry pi and sensehat must be provided neither of the tutor seem very happy about their job this is a small point and not a show stopper overall don t issue this course without major revision perhaps a new course team,1
1071,i did not enjoy this one i find it too politically charged a it emphasized the visual diversity religion ethnicity over the second order diversity diversity of professional profile and personality which should be the focus of a management course,1
1072,the content of the course is extremely useful however assignment need review a the exercise result have mistake and they are not explained very well missing step by step guidance,1
1073,this course is not well designed there are multiple mistake in the video assignment etc the content is covered after you already had to apply it in an assignment in a previous lesson the test are also not well made the instruction to peer reviewed assignment are not clear and will not bring you to the correct result which is shown during peer review no involvement from the faculty no one to answer question,1
1074,the capstone topic wa not very interesting,1
1075,some of the algorithm are pretty cool but overall the course is not worth it the material is pretty weak,1
1076,the course is for people having advanced knowledge in embedded architecture and knowledge until rd week is perfectly alright but from th week the course change to advanced knowledge i do not think an intermediate could easily grasp enough knowledge from the th week kindly do the needful to change it,1
1077,i found this course to be dry no practical example just information presentation like reading from a book the lecture do not prepare you very well for the quiz and even le for the assignment this is the only course in coursera that really got me disappointed since there are not many student in this course one might feel a bit left alone,1
1078,the information in the video wa very interesting and well presented i feel like i learned a lot however the quiz and test seemed to be of a very different level and often covered material that wa hardly discussed in the lecture i understand that student are expected to do independent learning of material but the gulf between lecture and test difficulty wa extreme if others were interested in learning about the basic of music theory i would not recommend this course,1
1079,the lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussion is deafening for an institution like the host institution this is odd i liked the course but it wa not very well organized seems like it wa for experienced musician eve though the goal of the course hinted at it being for beginner a well good course badly organized,1
1080,this course doe not do a good job at teaching the material the lecture video gloss over the topic briefly but do not give a thorough explanation of the core topic of the course the quiz will repeatedly test on term not even remotely mentioned in any of the course material,1
1081,this is a very unevenly paced and constructed course not at all delivered to the standard of the previous coursera course i have followed some lecture are clear and guide the learner step by step and then others suddenly assume a level of knowledge and sophistication that is at a significantly higher level and includes concept that have either not been introduced or have been dealt with in minimal detail it also end up focusing more on music analysis than music theory while there is a relationship between these approach i did not embark on this course to become an analyst a a practising musician i wanted to understand more of the concept behind what i do and hear very disappointed i will now look elsewhere to satisfy my learning,1
1082,most of this course felt inconsequential unhelpful and not worth the money i d condense some of the commonsense aspect into other section of the course and eliminate the minute of filler video,1
1083,nowhere near a useful a the first two course the assignment did not feel particularly relevant to the bulk of the course material,1
1084,the exercise are not very interesting the exercise initially focus on identifying a leader who we have worked with but it should also focus on how am i a a leader what is my level of emotional intelligence how do i scale up basis some test etc i lost interest in the course because it wa more about seeing some one else a a leader than myself there is a lot of research into the course yet it is too theoretical not put in precise interesting manner the module need to be shorter,1
1085,course material providing out dated concept argumentation throughout the course is shallow many of the the current argument are not mentioned from both side of the energy lobby fossil renewables,1
1086,although this course hold quite a lot of information it is quite slow in the way the information is transmitted and unfortunately the presenter did not made homework in term of preparing what to say in addition to the lagging of so anyways uhmm or just silence many of the video are also quite low in quality especially sound due to bad microphone overall the information wa interesting and useful and i m looking for part ii,1
1087,the virtual machine experiment wa very difficult to implement because the instructor format did not allowenough detailed instruction specific to each o platform regardless student did learn how to use vm ware to make a virtual cloud on a home network and control it via smartphone,1
1088,personally speaking the content are not helpful and the multiple choice quiz stuck me a lot,1
1089,feedback for the developed business model is missing and thus sigificant added value can not be captured,1
1090,i am a little disapointed with this course i have completed the third week but quiz are too big and the question are almost impossible to compare with the lecture it seems like what is evaluated is your ability of getting language nuance and not the epidemiology subject,1
1091,the content wa really neat and definitely not something i had been exposed to before i really liked the quantitative part of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz question on that the reason i am ranking this star is that i felt the quiz were unreasonably difficult or perhaps they had bug week quiz i had to take multiple time and really couldn t figure out what the correct answer wa looking at the discussion board i believe my sentiment is shared i have taken multiple coursera class astronomy astrobiology calculus and these are by far the most difficult quiz i have encountered,1
1092,pretty basic course with a lot of dead time not really learning anything about excel tutor should consider a few more advanced and useful topic,1
1093,course lecture are good but many quiz question are out of syllabus sorry i am not satisfied,1
1094,clustering topic is covered superficially too much time spend on employing ggplot graph not very useful since making graph is straightforward on other software like excel once you aggregate datasets correctly i had not found it very enriching a a course i would merge this class within r programming section and call it part rather than categorizing into exploratory data analysis,1
1095,ala after only minute of the first video i am reminded that this instructor doe not gear his lecture to the true beginner among u he speaks much more for an audience of grad student i do want to complete this specialization so i will try again perhaps after learning more about statistic and r and who know what else i fought my way through the first three course but now i m going to work smarter by finding other way to acquire this knowledge then return to him maybe this course should be labelled intermediate and statistic should be listed a a prerequisite i think since i don t know what it is that i don t know i am making a guess a to the missing piece of the puzzle,1
1096,the final project did not require use of the material in the course beyond the first week and a half i did not take any quiz or otherwise have my knowledge tested on the material in the second half of the course,1
1097,some swirl test don t work because of parameter method in qplot function this parameter is not realy existed in this function now,1
1098,i wish i could at least read the assignment if not get review on them in the audited version,1
1099,i have to say i am disappointed in that i feel there is little to no interaction here between student and instructor aide additionally the assignment are not functioning properly and it creates much confusion the instructor video are great and have been helpful but the rest is lacking there is no way to view other s body of work and critique are very vague etc this is photography where is the photography from learner other than the assignment why is there no gallery here,1
1100,good overview of the eu but you can not do the quiz unless you pay,1
1101,this course is where the material start to get difficult and the learning material fail to provide the structure needed there absolutely ha to be a better teaching method than reading the slide of bullet ed text that i m also showing no functional example are provided in the lecture and the real learning content is linked out to web resource you will have to google your way through this class because the provided instruction will not contain answer to the quiz or exam question a real disappointment i also think that coursera know this because this wa the first course where they ramped up the e mail encouragement campaign their data must tell them this is where people fall off the specialization rather than addressing with marketing and messaging they should encourage the instructor to improve the course,1
1102,the video is simple and good but the final project and some test are too hard based on material presented also staff s support are not good,1
1103,the video did not teach anything that wa going to be on the quiz so it wa like answering question at random using google the lesson plan and project were very vague and too much time wa spent trying to figure out what wa even being asked,1
1104,i believe this course suffers from neglect rarely did i see any of the mentor participating in the group discussion even though there were plenty of question furthermore some of the quiz questons seemed incomplete or confusing the project wa no better i feel like the course wa recorded a few year ago and not much done after that to fix flaw even though they are probably well known the material is useful but it would be nice to have a set of note or a text to go with the lecture you will spend a lot of time searching the internet to compelte the assignment sometimes that is good but other time a guide geared to the course would have been better,1
1105,the project at the end requires action that data scientist should know but doe not actually talk about the item for example the project book you hear about it but are not actually taught the right way to make one at best case you are taking a guess and at worst you are learning bad habit or missing out on what should be in it,1
1106,didn t really cover how to deal with messy data e g if you need to join to datasets and have orphan or you have no foreign key between two datasets and you need to use fuzzy matching basic validation wa also not covered i e making sure that your data cover all that you expect,1
1107,first noticeable thing is that the instructor doesn t convey competence very well he lack the practical example to explain the principle more efficiently the result for me wa that although he chose not to go deep the principle weren t a clear memorable or relevant a i think they could have been i did learn a few useful thing of course but it wa a disappointment in general,1
1108,please include exercise for computing the ratio and the valuation method in video question would have helped more the quiz doe not actually test the understanding of the topic in depth there can be some external reading suggested resource that help u get more understanding on the subject discussed,1
1109,the lab are not up to date and several thing do not work a they should i had to fix several of the provided script to finish them,1
1110,did not go into enough detail reiterated home cooking and spoil rate but did not get into specific perhaps another class on what food do what in your body would be beneficial,1
1111,it is a kind of introduction course a it wa mentioned on course info however it is very basic if there would be follow up course about the same topic it is a good start otherwise that is not a learning based lecture thank you for your understanding deniz ozalp,1
1112,this is a very basic course on food and nutrition i would consider the majority of the content to be common sense i would not recommend it if you already have an interest or general knowledge of nu,1
1113,general and shallow not very informative could be inspirational for those haven t cooked in a long time recipe are at the end of course,1
1114,very basic content i am not sure that there wa anything new for me in this course i am born in france and i guess we learn this from our family,1
1115,the professor just read the material through all the module and the course wa really boring but the content wa quite updated that wa the only good thing doe not worth such a high payment,1
1116,this course is just definition i will finish the course but i do not recommend it for someone who need a technical approach i wa expecting a few more technical example or exercise mixed with their accompanying definition this course are pure lecture no practice beyond open ended question i wish it wa a blend of lecture and practice and not so purely academic,1
1117,unfortunately no tutor instructor present to supervise the course which made inconsistency between course material slide video and solution calculated for assignment horribly annoying to deal with especially for someone like me new to the topic further the solver addin needed for the week assignment is not consistent across different excel version and libre calc which resulted in a whole lot of guesswork to pas this assignment i m sorry to say the course never came close to my expectation despite the very interesting topic would not recommend,1
1118,course need problem with explanation and or better feedback on quiz there is no way to tell what error one ha made it could even be rounding a student forum might be helpful too application of some formula is not clear leading to error on quiz in some case i have used external resource to give me a way to achieve the correct result,1
1119,frankly so far this is the best in career success but still not well presented,1
1120,a for information in course itself it wa interesting for me to enroll and to be part of the course but i highly dislike that there wa a feeling of that the lecturer is trying to remember any thing right while the video go it is not a real class it is a video and it could be done much more accurately there were many many boring moment while management itself is not a boring discipline it is very interesting anyway i am glad i participated in the course,1
1121,too simplistic and not enough real world example it wa clear instructor regurgitated material directly off of the screen offered zero highlight to real world experience or issue rather than wasting a couple hour listening to presentation download the slide and read them yourself disappointing,1
1122,i did not find this helpful for a complete beginner i will try an alternative course,1
1123,i have some html cs background i listened to the first module and then part of the second module for a intro level course to get a site up and running using word press i feel like it is missing some key information a a non beginner i am finding this course frustrating and not likely to continue there are definitely better course out there,1
1124,so basically it cut off it s like it give you part of the information and then drop off they also speed through it much like my old math teacher in college whcih caused of the class to drop now i m in them mist of it paid for blue host paid for my web name and it look like i m going to have to pay someone to finish it so bascially what i got wa a bunch of added on expense and still no web site i would not recommend this course,1
1125,out of a waste of time if i can not participate in discussion forum submit assignment or give review i might a well watch youtube lecture the course content wa very poor a well this is based on the unpaid material this course should be scrapped and not offered a an unpaid course it a classical case of bait and switch,1
1126,the material in this course is well presented though scarce at time however it ha it share of problem little to no interaction from ta s or mentor in the forum the quiz are often out of sync with the lecture the final exam ha severe problem with question form not content in more detail on the final exam some of the question don t even contain all the content to answer them they can request multiple answer but have single question box and or the reverse,1
1127,great first week i like fran s first week video with the puppet and very engaging interaction the next following week are total bummer it doe give some tip for character design such a what is tangent or some other design tip but it feel like a bloated interview and not a class like experience great first week terrible following week,1
1128,there wa concept taught in the first lesson that of density then it wa load of video of other people drawing character not actually going through a design process and then a few assignment designing a few character i wa hoping to learn more about some of the principle of character design wasnt blown away by this course wont be taking any more of these,1
1129,the course material did not cover anything that we needed to complete the final exam although i learned a lot working on the final exam i felt overly stressed i had to self teach myself in order to get through it,1
1130,i think this course might have been great if i did it like th or th in the certificate sequence i think this course assumes you have a lot of knowledge about both biology and statistic that i do not have nor will anyone else who ha only taken the first intro course even after having submitted my final assignment and peer reviewing others it is not clear whether or not i or any of my classmate used the correct method to complete the assignment a valid solution to the final project hasn t even been given to u a part of the course so i ll never know whether or not i did it correctly,1
1131,i have very mixed feeling after completing this course i can hardly say i feel i have learned any valuable stuff especially in contrast to the first course when i had a feeling i am growing with knowledge here i wa able to follow lecture instruction but i did not fully understand why i wa doing this and that i believe not enough foundation wa given to make people use the galaxy tool consciously the final project wa ridiculously far more difficult than what had been covered in the class i truly believe in the idea of giving ambitious final project but i do not believe in the idea of giving the project that is by no mean doable based on the course content very discouraging,1
1132,nice overview of galaxy but doe not really provide enough information for a beginner to start using it without additional resource,1
1133,this course is best for recent graduate it cover the basic feedback from course participant is not very valuable unfortunately people just don t have the time or the experience to give any substantial feedback for a project centered course i would expect feedback on the project your resume to be important a better course that cover the same topic in more detail is writing winning resume and cover letter i ve taken moocs on resume writing and this course is by far the best much better use of your time,1
1134,it appears the teacher doesn t take the necessary step to polish content and test everything feel unstructured and ad lib course video don t seem to follow any kind of logic or purpose and test are based on highly subjective content but are not prepared to deal with the subjectivity of reviewer i e forcing them to provide feedback instead of giving point arbitrarily,1
1135,the information is good but is going too fast and i don t feel i have learned much from it i m on week and i m still not sure of how to make my assignment in a proper way the quiz are very confusing too and sometimes i felt frustrated,1
1136,absolutely not apropriate for very beginner lack explanation of why through all the video simply giving you information to remember if you do this this will happen such a structure of explanation doesn t give freedom in the future to do something different a you don t get a general understanding of what you do additionally all course is tought in mac some command are different for window and they were not even mentioned in the video i did not sign up for this course to be forced to spend hour in google trying to find how to do something that supposed to be explained in the lesson overall the course absolutely lack attention to window user and is not appropriate for absolute beginner,1
1137,superinteresting subject but since i did not have access to all the literature through the website i wa not able to finish it unfortunatly,1
1138,if you want to know the array of option of the various tool in the tuxedo suite and don t want to read a manual then this course is for you i wa hoping that there would be some conceptual grounding in what each tool wa useful for but that wa not present at all,1
1139,there are better course than this for example yale game theory youtube explanation is not good,1
1140,some question in the quiz are not helpful for learning more about the topic for example how doe it help the learner to be able to answer what question the shirt of the presenter ha seriously,1
1141,this is a very basic course not at all college level,1
1142,this course is for people who are already relatively happy task are impossible for those who are not happy personally i couldn t define happines and couldn t remember anyone who i am grateful to,1
1143,lot of unnecessary information included in each video which make them long and boring number and length of video in each week are too much while the practical information you get are not enough,1
1144,it seemed this course wa a teaser to get people to enroll in pay money to join the dogcognition program at duke i realized this in week and did not continue the course,1
1145,while the topic is interesting the material are poor and the lecture are not particularly insightful the slide have several mistake and typo which make you doubt the whole course the speaker are not engaging and it just look like no effort wa made in preparing this course additionally the material do not prepare you for the review and on week and the hardest you don t have a chance to review the question or correct your mistake the course really need some improving,1
1146,basically not much content the guest speaker us unnecessarily weird example in his talk,1
1147,the subject matter is good but the course doe not adequately explain behavioral finance concept most of the course consists of slide deck to read there is a dearth of video content i expected better quality from a course provided through duke university,1
1148,the video lecture were good the test were almost a give away and the essay were an opportunity to practice what i learned from the lecture my only biggest disappointment is that the essay were evaluated by student like me i received evaluation that doesn t tell me much or evaluation that doesn t make sense if i only knew that this course wa not an instructor supervised course i would have been willing to pay extra money just to get a professional to ass my essay and provide me with feedback at this point i am disappointed that i decided to just watch the video but skip the peer reviewed essay and make the most of what i paid for,1
1149,i am learning a lot but i can not afford to pay,1
1150,some calc and formula are not clear otherwise the course allowed to have a general overview on financial instrument and trade,1
1151,the material wa interesting but it lacked in sufficient practice resource for the mathematical portion also instructor support feedback to student question wa lacking i found this course adequate if it wa free but not worth for the amount of resource i wa given to practice what we learned this is highlighted by the fact that the weekly quiz didn t show you the solution when you missed a question so you were left guessing instructor don t respond to student discussion question if the video didn t address that specific question type,1
1152,the class itself is quite good however you can not submit the module quiz without purchasing the certificate which is quite annoying,1
1153,in fact the course is fantastic i d say that is perfect but it is not because requires payment to be assessment in the activity,1
1154,content are interesting and useful even if the course deal with few topic i think it is too expensive a good grammar book is cheaper and more complete i would not enroll this course anymore,1
1155,the course wa too short and did not provide any reading material it would be more helpful to have more and shorter quiz,1
1156,i would not recommend this course to anyone interested in an introductory linguistics course while i understood the content of the lecture discussion video interview language informant video and required reading the quiz were far too difficult for a beginner course i found myself wanting to drop the course and the discussion forum show i am not alone in my frustration throughout the six week,1
1157,sell too much google and do not explain important thing,1
1158,i signed up to learn how to write good code but i don t feel like i learned much i passed the exam by writing an html document that wa syntactically and semantically correct but i don t know why it wa more correct than what i ve been doing on my own and can not be sure i ll will write better code in the future a a result i did learn a lot about the internet in general though i feel like i would have learned more and paid le money taking a course somewhere else or buying a book,1
1159,the teacher is excellent this is excellent but poor introduction to html the course which is part of specialization should be much more detailed with much more axamples i think it is not worth,1
1160,thank you for you time and for everything you did a an introduction i did not find that there s need to talk about the hosting and the other thing related to this topic it would be better if the instructor went deeper into the html,1
1161,this course wa clearly not ready the autograder for the final project wa a complete fail it wa not a fun experience trying to change around my code to figure out what the autograder wanted,1
1162,it may be a week course with a more slow learning because we see some tag in a second and it pass and the autograder work really bad i do not know where i fail but i failed all the question a peer grader would be nice for the final project,1
1163,disappointing not different from a class presentation poor in content lousy instructor,1
1164,i do not feel that this course is ready for publication and is overlong for the material presented,1
1165,there wa nothing in the course that i didn t already know but i m no longer young i didn t expect there to be i wasn t wild about sitting through lecture about being active while pregnant or making sure my kid exercise for me that s a waste of time i know what i need to be doing i wa hoping the course would inspire me to do it unfortunately it did not i got tired of hearing about walking or bicycling to work a the main way to get active i am now retired but even when i worked that wa never an option,1
1166,need to be more concise nick seems very passionate and trying to reach a broad audience but overly explaining topic is creating lecture fatigue for me for instance every video start with welcome back this is why people like this meat of the video this is what we just talked about see you next time i really just need the meat of the video part these video are minute long each they are very short and therefore i do not need an introduction closeout for each individual one the module overview and module recap video are sufficient to serve that purpose overall i learned the basic and will probably take the next gi course because i like the coursera framework but i think this particular course could be much more condensed,1
1167,informative but did not really feel like it wa of any use,1
1168,while it is a great course for all beginner to the guitar the only problem that i see is the grading system that is absolute loony it is left to other student to grade it and that may or may not show up to be graded by other student if it is not shown up to be graded by other student then you are left grade le for that assignment hence leaving you unable to complete this course and you can not receive your certificate or completion letter,1
1169,not a advanced a other coursera course this course if for participant who do not have any background in international relation and diplomacy wish they would have made it more advanced,1
1170,the lecture were not very interesting or instructive the reading material were much more so however the assignment in the class were based much more on the lecture and on self reflection than on the material i learned a little bit and a such found the course worth the time i put into it but i almost think one could get through this course with little difficulty without reading any of the written material and thus derive very little benefit from it i would encourage the maker of this course to do a significant revamping in addition to greater incorporation and emphasis on the written material i think more real life example of diplomatic success and failure would be a far more effective and entertaining use of the lecture time than the esoteric philosophising that seems to characterize it in this edition,1
1171,the algorithm presented in this course are interesting however the quiz contain some question that have no apparent relation to the content of the lecture and some question about detail of the presented algorithm which are explained in neither the lecture nor in the paper from which the lecture are derived also most of the sample implementation will not run on a modern computer they only work on window with java installed,1
1172,the video did cover the basic theory behind all the method for portfolio management however they were just basic theory with no explanation on how to practically implement them and then asking u who only understand the theory from the video to suddenly try to solve the calculation quiz especially those excel calculation without any practice on how to implement them beforehand besides the video only showed the formula with no example at all very disappointed with the course this course is not recommended for those who have zero or little experience in the field,1
1173,i am not connecting to the instructor at all the material is well managed and organized but i am not able to really hear or understand further my connection to the site is disturbing in this and a couple of other course the video lecture jump around and begin in the middle of the lecture between these two issue i am not having a good experience with this course i live in the u and have graduate degree in public health,1
1174,lecture quality is not a good a other session of the course plus the grading system is not upto the mark people evaluating others performance themselves don t know how they are suppose to evaluate grading must be done by professor all other isb module are far better on course era except this one no offence but it s true,1
1175,do not recommend chaotic and full of irrelevant imo information doe it really matter in which year some paper wa written or from which latin word the term interest rate derives,1
1176,the lecture video are available intergrally on youtube whereas on coursera there are some part that are missing the student answer on the blog are not answered from coursera staff,1
1177,too basic and not thorough enough the assignment are too easy also because of over specific assignment instruction,1
1178,we are given inadequate information in the video and no other resource to write a program required to use method not covered in the course,1
1179,give you needed basic on html cs and javascript for the rest of the specialisation however could definitely expand the j aspect a lot more explaining the type system the prototype chain concept making u aware of what the language can and can not do to more week would have been expected from this course,1
1180,very basic and not especially much fun or challenging,1
1181,a good course the method and pace wa not good enough i wonder if those new to these topic learnt anything,1
1182,sorry but although i found the topic of interest i found the delivery very dull yes prof covach know his stuff but basically what we got here wa little more than a reading of text from his book i know he explained why the actual music wa not included but think he could have done more to provide link and stimulate listening i eventually just started reading the transcribed text of the lecture a i did not find looking at prof covach s talking head at all stimulating prof covach did nothing to stimulate discussion in the forum and although i posted a few thing there wa very little going on in the forum i bought the book on the basis of being interested in the topic but it is not at all necessary for the course,1
1183,content is not excellent the trainer is just reading a text while slide are passing trough the screen no example no analogy no explanation whatsoever i wouldn t call that a training i m quite disappointed,1
1184,lecture are very monotonous sounding it would be better to make them sound more conversational with pause question etc granted it can not be interactive since it s not a live classroom but it can be made to somewhat sound like an interactive session some slide are too verbal it would be better to have multiple small demo in a module for different slide topic instead of just monotonically reading out the slide and then having one demo at the end too many lab issue no one responded or addressed them in a class with such a short span week it s very important that everything work and any question concern are immediately addressed resolved please consider making the lab instruction available for download say a pdf file this will be helpful for any later reference,1
1185,headed downhill lesson are starting to feel like not enough time wa put into preperation or like this course wa assigned a a project to some student so the professor could make a dollar like textbook one of the instructor even said at one point they didn t have enough time what doe that even mean in an online course you could be fixing it right now and improving the course this whole thing is being handled like a college course and that is crazy on line course can undergo continual improvement the college course paradigm is dying because we can do it better now fail,1
1186,there is a choice in assignment you can do them either written or video however the evaluation highly favor video and it is not possible to pas te course without doing them course staff do not respond to this issue not very motivating,1
1187,it seemed to me like an ad or pr sentation for this high school it had some interesting thought in it but not much information,1
1188,tutor is russian i guess her accent is not quite understandable,1
1189,unfortunately it s very poor material and lecturer is not expirienced yet enough,1
1190,it wa very hard for me to learn i am not good at javascript,1
1191,please change this course completely sure you need at least x more time to do a good course the course is very fast and the lesson are not enoght to teach in a good way bad bad course,1
1192,it seemed to move way to quickly without a good explanation of how to use the script i learned a lot in html and cs under this proff but not a lot from this course i continue to review it and look up other resource,1
1193,not a detailed a i would have liked however i did indeed learn a few thing in this case it may have been because i m a professional developer just not a web developer i sort of wanted more but perhaps it s inappropriate for me to ask nevertheless i do feel the course wa rather week overall,1
1194,this course had too much content in one run and some of the topic assignment had too much confusing question and answer which were hard to figure out made this course a bit a bad experience the same go for the end assignment project where much functionality wa required within a short time and the course wa delayed so many of the student could not fit it into their schedule,1
1195,chaotic organization unclear instruction and confusing due date i would not recommend such specialization,1
1196,never before have i had to create so many fake account nor write so many long and laborious manuscript to be able to complete the assignment there were also so many problem with this last and final capstone project delay in start date plague of technical issue from coursera lack of support from teaching staff and coursera when issue were experienced and instruction that were not clear enough at time i m very much glad to be done and congratulation to all of you who made it through this last and arduous process job well done,1
1197,the instructor were not very engaging,1
1198,i am a bit frustrated a the course is built around this amazing tool ibm bluemix that gave u high hope of extracting super useful information but it is impossible to use the instruction seem outdated and not relevant to the actual tool there are lot of different set that make it even more confusing and even after getting round a lot of the technical difficulty the tool doesn t seem to be very useful i feel like i wasted a lot of time trying to get this to work with no result so far,1
1199,this course ha some great information and guidance for delving into the social medium landscape however the tool that come with the paid version are not easy to use or well explained for the lay person,1
1200,not the best one on coursera included many detail that are not really relevant and quiz just checked if you memorized it,1
1201,could have been better should explain not just read out the presentation anyone can do that,1
1202,so basic and only useful for common knowledge not something for a specialization,1
1203,much expected from this course but this course is not up to the mark,1
1204,i did not like this course it is a course for those who are already involved into the topic not newbie very general short and sloppy explanation and a lot of practical assignment for peer evaluation i had a lot of experience in classical music but i wa puzzled with what go on in this course after having completed some other jazz course i realized that i had no chance to learn anything here since the theory is not explained sufficiently the title of the course is misleading it rather should be called a master class on jazz improvisation,1
1205,the video are slow and unengaging and way too much text on each slide a few of the assignment have been weird not so good brief and hard to find out how to do it correct and well,1
1206,video lecture are really bored bad presented and almost useless most if not all of the useful content is presented in section called web tour which are collection of website were one can find information about the specific topic of a lesson but many of the website are bad organized difficult to read navigate or simply outdated the course should be called web resource about iot i forced myself to keep going for two week module before i decided to buy a good book and take a more specific course like the one about real time system,1
1207,the material in this course is well presented though scarce at time however it ha it share of problem little to no interaction from ta s or mentor in the forum the quiz are often out of sync with the lecture the final exam ha severe problem with question form not content in more detail on the final exam some of the question don t even contain all the content to answer them they can request multiple answer but have single question box and or the reverse,1
1208,the material is very interesting there a a huge number of quiz over poorly explained or not at all explained model which would still be an interesting challenge if the model themselves had better explanation this ha been the most frustrating coursera class i have taken not because of the subject difficulty but because of the lack of adequate resource for working with the model,1
1209,she just started with wk there should have been more explanation and video in week not very interesting i think statistic you need to take in person,1
1210,this course wa not overly interesting it felt more like listening to someone wanting to paint everything with a socialist brush i had better thing to do this ha not been a class where i learned much it structure of super short video min with easy test wa neither challenging nor useful to confirm the value of the content in fact a number of test quiz you on material not yet covered usually in the next unit not the best class there is,1
1211,idk it not what i expected i really want to start with actually making a computer game not a paper game,1
1212,this course is really hard and i am having alot trouble understanding it overall it is not one of the best course i have taken,1
1213,it is really not for beginner the first week wa ok but we didn t spend much time coding then it wa really difficult to follow,1
1214,couldn t fiish the course not hard but exhausting and not interesting,1
1215,could not get through the first week way too much emphasis on bluej and duke university specific library i i already have a decent foundation in coding and took the course with the idea i could get a refresher on java if your a beginner there are way better course out there this course is all over the place and i could see it being confusing for someone just picking up programming,1
1216,some lesson are too simple the homework is not very clear and you need much more time to do it than it is said,1
1217,this class wa actually about responsive web design not information design the two are in no way synonymous information design is about the visual display of information in a way that aid comprehension responsive web design is about creating different interface for different device form factor i m not sure how a professor could possibly mix up the two but he did the only reason i m not giving it star is that there wa in fact some interesting info about responsive web design if coursera would change the title to responsive web design instead of information design i d give the course star,1
1218,assignment are not always relevant or clearly explained more resource on how to complete them properly for example suggestion about how to do prototyping and what tool to use would also help improve this course,1
1219,i m several month into this specialization it seems to practice little of what it preaches in it design and pedagogy i ve paused repeatedly because i find the whole experience needlessly clunky and frustrating and i rarely feel like i ve learned much at the end of the assignment i often wonder if anyone on the ucsd coursera side ever actually try to complete the assignment the quiz is missing key link and the question read a if they were written by someone who s first language is not english pretty sloppy effort,1
1220,this specialisation started off good in the first course but ha since taken many step back the content is dated and not well though through and it feel like the whole thing could have been put into course,1
1221,video lecture did not provide much information coursework instruction were unclear and had typo i enrolled in november but the course start date kept getting pushed back by a week or two at a time until it wa ready month later with all of the extra time taken to put the course together i expected to get a lot more out of it,1
1222,i wa quite disappointed by this course after several delay the course stated month later than originally planned the video are badly edited and there did not seem to be a lot of content within this course,1
1223,my suggestion video pace is way too fast and without much visuals and a clear structure plan hard to fully grab in one view i don t think your mn max duration really make sense when the content is of interest better to make it longer to improve clarity positive you provide written text version of your video support document way too many and not always relevant quiz i don t think that asking u the name of a founder etc really test anything about our understanding of our lesson too many irrelevant question all in all it seems you applied one of the rule you discus in this course release fast and adjust later on based on customer feedback unsure this is the right approach when it come to online learning i had higher expectation v mine telecom,1
1224,he ha a clear outline but his definition are not clear and are very vague his thought process is unorganized,1
1225,the course content wa somewhat scattered and lacked focus i think the whole topic of the talent pipeline wa completely lacking structure and cohesiveness cheri s presentation were not a engaging a the others and her slide were poorly prepared often difficult to read and not necessarily related to the topic at hand,1
1226,one of the main presenter who led about half of this course would greatly benefit from an editor to help them organize their idea this and a presentation style that made me feel talked down to similar to reading a story book to a small child made comprehension of idea frustratingly difficult the content they were responsible for covering wa why i signed up for a paid multi course specialization though i learned lot of other thing i ll no doubt find helpful i did not walk away with the information i need the most the other presenter were great a usual and presented their topic in a clear concise manner,1
1227,the part of course from prof sytch and prof derue wa really interesting and important but i can not complete this course because part of dr alexander is impossible to listen it is necessary all the time to separate useful information from enormous amount of information about her private life is it a course about private life of dr alexander or about managing talent and i am year not she is talking with u like we are small kid and so she can keep our attention only by special voice and multiple story her private life,1
1228,i thought the course wa oldfashioned it doesn t prepare you to be a journalist in the digital age where term like crowdfunding search ability new businessmodels apps and social medium are key factor of success yes there wa a small section where they explained crowdsourcing lol but interviewing a many people a you can seems to be cryptosaurus approach also the social medium tip seem to be very interesting if you re it s worth following this course for free but definately not your money the free course on futurelearn had ten time more content and i learned so much more,1
1229,i found difficult to navigate within the course and the style of the course is not very modern i felt difficult to follow the whole program which might be also linked to my level of english that might not have been good enough considering the technical vocabulary used in the program however some interesting and very concrete tip to learn,1
1230,this is a good course but if you think better and deeply you will understand that deep inside you your self know this thing but maybe you did not do in daily life,1
1231,this will be an excellent course for undergrad and high school student but not much in depth knowledge and learning strategy for higher level of education teacher show mastery on their subject matter though their presentation style is not genuine and naturally animated to the point that it may feel boring,1
1232,i can access to some content video and lecture but i can not send quiz or assignment and to get feedback without paying a fee for this course very limited,1
1233,this course is rather superficial it sadly did not provide practical tip that go beyond common sense,1
1234,the contains of the course is not really enough for improve the writing skill for scientific paper those advice mention in the video is common and that s it no more practice or example to help the learner understand or apply that concept to their writing,1
1235,i wa quite disappointed in the capstone i have not found the quality of the question to be very high and more than once there ha been a disconnect between the question asked and how the reviewer is asked to grade it i understand there are some limitation in working with such a large and diverse group of student but peer reviewing is not productive or particularly helpful and i expected more interaction with the professor for a capstone especially one that come at a cost,1
1236,ok the main professor clearly know his stuff on the other hand he go into unnecessary detail and then quiz you on it even though it not relevant to the course typical brick and mortar education type b the assistant instructor likely this guy student are not a great and the whole thing is amateur night,1
1237,ok introduction to material property but not rigorous leaf out definition motivation and conclusion consequence and skip some thing that come up on the quiz no worked example,1
1238,the video lecture are not very polished and i think it would have been better to have a few longer video than so many short one,1
1239,course address some elementary issue about iot but the instructor at time seems like he doe not have a good grasp of the lecture material no access to quiz or evaluation a auditing participant which is a shame since most of the coursera moocs allow access to evaluation material under the auditing modality,1
1240,only because of technical issue that i faced in most of the video are not loading properly they will stuck somewhere and only audio will be continuing so i couldnt finish the course apart from that teaching is really good hope you guy work on it to fix it,1
1241,i thought the material wa presented at an overly high level and wa not particularly useful particularly in the second half of the course add more detail furthermore the presentation style of the professor is not engaging nor doe he address interesting archetype or example in his lecture the early material wa fine but again presentation could be dramatically improved lastly the assignment were rather interesting early on but once again quality decreased a the course progressed,1
1242,this class is an extreme example of an introduction to a subject very basic information i would guess that anyone who actually know the term internet of thing and wa able to find this course already know all of the content presented here for completeness and ensuring that everyone is on the same page i suppose it it required i took off one star for how basic yet drawn out the information is it could have been covered in a single week the other two star came off because of how tedious the peer review assignment are and how little they add to the understanding of the content it is not hard to understand so the assignment end up just being busy work the two star i gave were because the instructor seems knowledgable and the rest of the specialization look promising,1
1243,very rushed incomplete example and gap in content i m not sure what audience coursera is aiming for but it doesn t seem to be anyone who doesn t already know a programming language,1
1244,the course look a lot like advertisement of a textbook i don t have anything against ad but ad are not very suitable for teaching,1
1245,the quiz are about the course structure and not product management,1
1246,only the link agilemanifesto org ha real value in this course the rest is self pr and water i see no reason paying for the sertificate and i am not convinced further cources of this specialization will deliver greater value,1
1247,extremely clear presentation by the researcher but loses star for relying on assignment based on google doc which did not load properly and resulted in me not being able to complete the course,1
1248,this course wa actually quite helpful for learning chinese and it provides fascinating information about chinese culture besides learning the language you ll learn about holiday food and art and you ll hear chinese music unfortunately i could not give the course a good rating because i found some quiz question impossible to complete this question required answer to be typed in pinyin or in chinese character however the course gave no information on how to type the pinyin tone mark or chinese character into the response box i tried asking about this in a discussion forum but got no answer,1
1249,the testing in this course is horribly crafted not is it only too easy thus not actually testing student what is learned the answer for some of the question are incorrect on the very last quiz i wa not able to finish the course because the answer for one of the question wa incorrect in answering how to translate south the answer should be n nbian but when i selected this option it wa marked wrong therefore i have to wait more hour before selecting an incorrect answer to complete the course,1
1250,i think it is a very basic course or for people who have very little previous knowledge the concept are not very clear it may not be appropriate for a person who already ha college education,1
1251,these theme felt very surface level and redundant the material could likely have been covered more quickly and allowed for more time to be spent on more tangible every day information that might help those that are not already teacher,1
1252,the course content is perfect however the rating system is kind of disappointing first the rating is very subjective thus i might pay great effort to my submission but get a grade below my expectation second sometimes i can be busy on weekend thus i want to finish the peer review earlier on friday however there might often be not enough submission to be reviewed thus i am very pressured to do this with a exhausted mind and body in the evening on sunday could i just pas if there s no other submission to review,1
1253,there is quality implicit in the approach taken but in my opinion this course is excessively short having only minute of video per week what is very limiting also there is no slide of the material covered what i find not adequate to fully grasp the theory underlyind in the lecture slide would be determinant just watching video and doing quiz is not a very effective form of learning,1
1254,the course and the knowledge provided is ok but the peer correcting is really bad it take tool long some people are cheating and if you re unlucky you may not be corrected at all and fail the course,1
1255,better than the first course of the specialization but the concept are still explained not clearly,1
1256,some good information but very much a political course not much of an economics course stating a if it is a given late in the course that there are time when it is okay to introduce a moral hazard erroneously defining fiat money early in the course stating again a if it were a given that deficit spending is naturally the right answer to a crisis when politician and their pawn develop a course should we be surprised that the answer is always more government intervention oh if only we had more tool to stop this never realizing their role in creating the crisis,1
1257,i would like more task to help learn it s also really really easy to guess your way to the right answer a lot of concept word and specific tool are introduced with not much opportunity to actually use them meaningfully and feel that one ha actually learned a skill a opposed to temporarily remembered the concept for the quiz wa nice not to have to watch video though and the slide are good,1
1258,overall some week were fun some notin some week are too many chapter and exercise i actually think that the exercise are too complicated compared to the example in the chapter sometimes are the explanation in the chapter not sufficient it would be helpful to know the name of a proof e g perch s law or law of the excluded middle this would help to find more information and help,1
1259,i initially found the week two section very frustrating due to the absence of worded example real sentence that might ve appeared alongside the logic symbol that were being defined i would put it down to a personal fault if it were not the case that i grasped the notation fully within minute of finding another source of learning,1
1260,in my opinion the sound quality is quite low and this make it difficult to follow the lecture smoothly and i found the current response in the fqa section of the course to this problem very unusefull and discouraging i am guessing that the course is not really meant for absolute beginner and some previous knowledge of programming and such is needed i did not have any knowledge in those area and i found it hard to follow everything mentioned in the course so i switched to another course on a different platform to be able to make the best of my time,1
1261,mistake during the video are only corrected in it review often there s a new attempt of andrew ng to say something without even cutting out the first attempt the mathematical symbol sometimes didn t encode at all the quality need to be redone a this wa not a completely satisfying experience for an usd course,1
1262,the lecturer is very good the course is not very insightful and on the surface it is business oriented it doesn t deal with interesting and challenging academic problem,1
1263,fairly good video explaining the material probably worth start however the written support material should be improved imho the video should supplement the written material i e it should be possible to learn the material only by reading this is not the case so frequent pausing of video and making lot of note is needed if one want to commit this course to long term memory,1
1264,level of difficulty of lecture is not correspond with level of quiz in lecture they are talking about simple stuff and then in quiz they ask you about detail they didn t mentioned you could deducts this information though but this is exactly the main problem with this course for quiz you should deduct and learn by yourself so much stuff that video start to be not worth your time,1
1265,asked for more feedback for peer that found my final paper insufficient received nothing asked for guidance from staff received nothing excellent course with great content but i have issue with the evaluation process when peer and staff do not participate in the advertised method of communicating their concern with my work,1
1266,it is good for non english native speaker it is not free i liked most the additional material,1
1267,unlike the previous course in this sequence this course provided little to no substantial information while i fully agree with the premise of the course the importance of leadership communication through storytelling this course presented no source psychological research or evidence to defend it argument it provided great lay advice with little to no research base i would not recommend this course for anything beyond casual reading it is not substantiated,1
1268,topic were basic but good but i can not understand why a physic undergrad with no screen presence and mispronunciation wa asked to lead this course instead of the mba professor who wa advertised i found that there were at least a couple of place that were ageist and overly simplistic in talking about retirement planning and there were moment that there wa a paranoid anti government vibe that i found off putting,1
1269,the lecture present google s zmot marketing model how it benefited and shaped marketing research and strategy to increase conversion and loyalty it is a good contextual introduction if you never heard of search engine marketing cost per acquisition or click through rate if you know the basic it is probably not a good use of your time i didn t like that the content feel like evangelism for paid google service and most source of the course are either random blog or related to interested party google twitter i still learnt a couple of cool metric i didn t know about but the course didn t bring any added value to the blog link provided,1
1270,too much theoretical this course should not be a separate course it can be a part of other course,1
1271,very boring lecture the professor should not read the slide but actually try to speak her own word because this is causing lost interest and a a result le attention paid and le knowledge received,1
1272,this type of course structure may work at an undergrad level but for continuing education it is sub par the video lecture were the instructor reading the slide reading from the course reading or showing video that were listed in the course reading the course quiz had too many question that focused on memorizing detail from the case study or a statistic shown for a bit in the lecture rather than try to foster understanding of the material there were some technical issue such a link from the course reading expiring and not being replaced in lecture question dealing with a subject matter different from the topic of the lecture etc the one good thing from this course it us a great textbook free which provides lot and lot of useful data and insight into digital marketing and this is the sole reason the course get star instead of,1
1273,i did not like the teacher but i did like the course material,1
1274,not up to my expectation compared to the previous module in this specialisation the lecture are dry the presenter is not focused and slide are sometimes mixed up the reading material is great and a definite plus is that it is free but the lecture should be more practical not just the bullet point of the book and the weekly assignment should not be a chapter summary question the course developer should have taken the time to develop a case study for each topic like in the first module in this spec i highly recommend reviewing and improving the content,1
1275,the presenter in this course is hard to follow and doe not have good slide she often doe not put her bullet point or list on the slide i am a visual learner and she doe not provide enough on screen info she is really uncomfortable and make it really hard to listen to her talk she struggle through the entire presentation which is just super distracting content is good though,1
1276,i think this course could have been more interesting it wa very dry with just slide and majority of the example were not explained well especially the one about the marketing plan wa not about plan but about presentation skill this course content definitely need update,1
1277,this course is not a good a the one that are part of the digital marketing specialization it wa hard to keep traction and interest to finish it,1
1278,for multiple module the question were out of order some of the video didn t seem polished to the point that it made me think it wa not the final edits also from other coursera course i really valued interview and summary that highlighted the key point v a summary of the topic convered finally the module quiz didn t seem to highlight the key point but instead had question specific to not so important detail e g which agency created the mb campaign,1
1279,based on impression after module quality of lecture just dry material from book not engaging repetition video in reading material and in lecture sometimes feeling that it is waste of time quizz question are hardly connected to lecturesdisappointed and discouraged give a try to module and will see,1
1280,the course can be summarized a ok here are some tool that can be used now read the documentation stack overflow and some paper that we give you link to each week there are just few video what i expect from a course are baby step and clear guidance about good practice of course you can learn it all from the internet i am taking a course to get something i will not easily find elsewhere a good teacher who will guide me through optimal approach,1
1281,this course wa not nearly a valuable to me a the first course in the series it breezed through a bunch of different plot type without explaining in enough detail what they would be used for or when you should choose to use them at the same time it also didn t provide enough clear example of how to do basic thing in matplotlib which seems to me to be a very non intuitive thing with poor documentation i found the first assignment to be very difficult,1
1282,i am really not sure if you need minute video to explain the material i think maybe minute clear with some good example would be more helpful i fell sleep during some of the lecture boring long and not sure if necessary on the other hand i guess minute is good because you learn to put up with argument and clear them up yourself also maybe this course wa directed towards high school student thus the long explanation overall a i said on the beginning it would work better with clear definition and some example and discussion board,1
1283,course is not for free and misleading,1
1284,for pay quiz feedback is not part of the mooc education movement,1
1285,video is of poor quality instructor distracts you picking up his glass from his nose every second reading outdated you can suggests book from on digital topic and last assignment is based on a website that is not longer online,1
1286,i understand that this is a project centered course however i do not feel like i walked away with a solid foundation of what go into creating synthesizer sound sure i learned that i can change parameter within a synthesis program and thereby get various sound but that s about all i wa expecting to gain fundamental understanding of the various parameter and what they really do and a more solid understanding of the process of creating custom patch rather then following an example and subsequently making minor adjustment so that it fit my style,1
1287,it doe not fully utilize the power and possibility of a mooc student can not study at their own pace there is no live interaction standard quiz and assignment which is a bit ironic peer reviewing really brings down the quality of the feedback not everyone is capable of testing evaluating and giving constructive feedback,1
1288,a it is unfortunetly i can only rate it a a the lecture are presented in a reasonable way but this is a somewhat technical course for wich additional material would need to be mandatory there are no slide for the lecture the instructor mention chapter of a book and doe not provide the material to student pursue a more effective way of studying the material also the quiz are excessively challeging taking into consideration that the only resource availble to student are the video in my opinion presenting a course that only ha video is not an effective way of learning to make this course more effective and to allow student to learn more effectivelly and get some learning objective more material besides the video must be made available a it is no more than a is possible to rate this course,1
1289,the professor doe not pronounce the word correctly his english grammar is bad the term used are too difficult to understand and way of teaching is too complicated the ppts are full of error and too direct there is no continuity i hardly learnt anything from this video,1
1290,i enjoyed some of this course content but mostly did not enjoy the course delivery the instructor is very warm and friendly but not well articulate also the way the course content is extremely segmented into short video with sec intro to each video is extremely distracting and interrupted my concentration i i felt the video with tiffany were unnecessary and a waste of time also i felt there were not enough example or really life example especially later in the course when describing different type of date and analysis,1
1291,lack of example sometimes it is not easy to understand what lesson is about,1
1292,in my opinion the professor s accent and speaking style make the content difficult to understand in addition the course doe not seem to have been properly designed,1
1293,the week and are really good the week and are going to fast and the thing that are teached are not connectes with each other well so it impossible to do the assignment and assignment ha nothing to do with what is tought in week,1
1294,i do like the course but coursera ha disabled discussion forum for this course which make it impossible for the student to interact and find answer to problem or discus possible error in the example code student interaction is one of the strongest aspect of moocs without it this might a well be nothing more than a series of youtube video had coursera not discontinued the discussion forum i d have given this course four or five star,1
1295,i did not feel that i learned a much in this course a in the previous course of the series the assignment in particular seemed trivial and were compromised even further due to some technical problem with the simulator recommended for student without access to actual hardware this course would be a good candidate for revision with a focus on gradually increasing the depth and complexity from stage to stage and on commonly used component such a current amplifier and shift register problem with the simulator should not be cause for compromising the assignment themselves there are other way to address those problem many of which were employed by student a they competed their assignment,1
1296,week and lecture are robotic most material taken directly from the internet it is just a form of regurgitation of online article from strategy consulting firm with quiz s artificially made more difficult with cheap word play the lecturer for week and week should resign with immediate effect and find a job at a school for lower class student where she can continue to brag about her industry expertise without being so irritating definitely not ie business school material,1
1297,i am afraid that this course is to a large extend a marketing tool for promoting the instructor proprietary product it use is therefore limited for the practitioner that want a foundation on the free python data ml capability i would not recommend this course to my colleague,1
1298,course is too slow to keep focus it s repetitive but not clear when it s really needed,1
1299,the class are not practical and the voice of the teacher is very monotone boring,1
1300,good information but not good for people lacking background knowledge lecturer read off slide and give very little supplementary information,1
1301,after the first two introduction the course wa not for me,1
1302,unfortunately i did not find the course overly engaging and only provided very basic information it would have been more interesting to look at a few thing more in depth,1
1303,the subject matter is of great interest to me but unfortunately dr silverman standing paralyzed before a projected backdrop and lecturing in a monotone doesn t do it too much talking head actually motionless body and too few visuals of course material i m sure he s a brilliant man but an adequate lecturer he is not if he s so shy he might just do voice over i have dropped the course and will just read the book i would not incidentally rate the course at an intermediate level beginning would be more accurate onscreen video are bad enough being at one remove from the classroom but onscreen video of an immobile monotone lecturer will kill any subject,1
1304,i wa actually very excited for this course yet it disappointed me the lecture were monotonous and stiff i found myself watching the video on mute with the subtitle on p s the person who transcribed the video should have taken the time to see and hear what they were translating since there are quite a few error on name location even simple word i also found the lesson rather superficial did not dive into the heart of this great civilization finally having read a book or two on the subject the whole experience added almost nothing to my previous knowledge on ancient egypt the course is good for those who have no previous knowledge on the subject and wish to learn the basic regarding egypt it god mummy etc,1
1305,i wa disappointed by this course i thought it wa poorly organized and focused too much on trivia and not enough on motivating and contextualizing ancient egyptian civilization i wa hoping to come away from this course with a richer understanding of ancient egypt the lecture were surprisingly dry,1
1306,definitely not for a beginner wish there were more visuals and assignment to do alongside the professor instead it is a lecture from power point that don t really line up with the assignment very well if you have previous knowledge in another language you ll do fine but if you re truly looking for a beginner course look elsewhere many assumption are made by this professor that make it le approachable by a beginner imo,1
1307,assignment is unclear and confusing the material which is given is not enough i think the course is good in general but it should focus in building the knowledge more instead of leaving many thing on the air and going through the material a if it were a quick review,1
1308,this course and it related course are rough around the edge thing are not always intuitive,1
1309,i hate to write a negative review when the designer of the course have clearly put a lot of love and attention to detail into making it but the quality of the code is bad the quality of the testing code is even worse this endeavour to teach some horrible practice that s a shame because the editing quality of the video is excellent the use of git and rspec is likewise commendable even worse it s not entirely clear who the target audience is a lot of the topic introduced are aimed at complete novice yet not explained in a way novice might understand the course need some serious rethinking and refactoring,1
1310,lost after nd week i really liked the python for everyone course so i thought i would like this one a well but it wa not done to the same standard i will find another way to learn ruby,1
1311,most of the lecture were very rushed and brief they quote fact and name and rarely bother to elaborate on them the interview that often serve a a second lecture for the week mostly repeat the first lecture average duration for both minute almost no reading material in english the translation in english isn t very good the peer review process for the final assignment is flawed since you will be given to review work in spanish and english with no option to skip to an essay in a language you understand the grading criterion is also flawed for example the required length of the essay doe not seem to be obligatory the staff rarely bother with answer in the discussion forumall in all it is an interesting topic and a good starting point for your own research sadly it is one of the worst course i have taken part in,1
1312,there have been some undesirable reference to equation in term of equating modeling to economic growth and investment i wa interested by the syllabus and it outline of theory and the mean to use model to study social science and system science after week though it wa not a very interesting course so i considered trying to simply survey most of the video to gain some more information not necessarily for any more insight from the professor from the university of michigan,1
1313,the course ha many mistake especially the quiz solution the staff wa not very active answering forum question in some way i felt disappointed taking this course because the quality is very poor in comparison to the other three course of this specialization however i hope this review help the staff to improve the quality of this course for future student considering that the teacher ha a great methodology to explain the content,1
1314,the accent presentation stuttering is too cloudy not suitable for foreigner,1
1315,actually a great class on a topic that is highly relevant in theory and practice alike the problem of this class is mostly one assignment the statement of problem set is very unclear while the feedback from the grader is too little to improve anything forum didn t help either despite my arguably strong technical background i had to give up at this point since i simply can not invest arbitrary amount of time too bad for the rest of the course which i wa looking forward to a lot,1
1316,well structured in term of content and the basic framework but the delivery is dull yes i know it is phys chem but i do think there must be way to jazz it up gave up after week so i can not comment on the whole course,1
1317,quiz wa not well structured and title suggested a different idea than what the course wa really about it a teacher guide,1
1318,the concept of this course is unique and pretty interesting but video are too short basic and non specific they have vague connection with the rest of the material and the design of the test and assignment is just awful the question with multiple choice work wrong marking all the right answer is not appropriate you must choose the all of the above option but it is wrong because of formal logic the correct option here is only to match all the answer and the all of the above line also many question are debatable and there is no answer in the material for the course and finally the uploading of the last assignment wa just impossible for more than a week and i don t know if it will ever be possible bad experience,1
1319,it wa a very interesting course however it wa biased toward spanish history with the inclusion i wa really more interested in what i thought the course wa supposed to be about anyway medieval manuscript i had a terrible time deciphering the lecturer s english and because i m not interested in a course certificate the course project were a waste of my time though i can see that they could be fun and add to the enjoyment of the course,1
1320,this is clearly not the right medium for prof clifton this wa inferior to the first installment which had a great many problem on it own poor on camera delivery lack of familiarity with the material and a tendency to just read the ppt slide on the screen are just a few of the problem while the content is good you really have to work to get through the presentation of the material,1
1321,i did not like the teacher but i did like the course material,1
1322,disappointed by this class instructor and mentor added not value to course the main reading emarketing wa good but all video content and assignment were directly from the emarketing guide by rob stokes also they couldn t even get rob stokes name spelled correctly in the reference,1
1323,i dropped on week there wa just the required minimum for a mooc i did not find it engaging too bad a i wa genuinely curious of the topic,1
1324,please we all have accent but i can not understand some word and make it more difficult,1
1325,good course but severely hobbled by the transition to the new platform many technical issue in the quiz such a question not showing up being marked incorrectly leaf the student feeling somewhat forgotten which is a shame considering the brilliant material being presented,1
1326,the course wa ported to the new coursera platform in a amateurish way without any testing learner have been complaining on the forum for month about bug and missing information in the assessment and they are still not fixed the content is generally interesting but not presented in a cohesive way many concept are juggled with without giving clear mathematical definition,1
1327,i would not recommend this course the content is very relevant to the subject matter however the lecture are much longer than they need to be and filled with unnecessary commentary the instructor often verbally discus the statistical formula with a few bullet on a slide with the focus on himself the delivery would be much better if the instructor would put himself in the background and the focus be reoriented on a whiteboard style walk through of the equation at hand,1
1328,i give star for the teacher really approach having such a well organized teaching material i also give star for the homework assignment and it almost graphlab only approach yes it mentioned alternative approach which is much more popular than graphlab but there are many bug trivial difficulty to get it through with scikit learn a a great open source package the only reason i suspect to choose graphlab is commercial purpose for me if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into panda i can finish each programming assignment within hour for sure using scikit learn but now it take minute and i still can not load the data correctly i like to get a certificate but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time,1
1329,tbh this class s experience is not good the lecturer seem unprepared and they talk very repetitively,1
1330,excessive use of graphlab create which is not an industry standard,1
1331,the subjectes are not learnt deeply and precisely too summarized and vague,1
1332,good course the only major drawback is the requirement of graphlab which doesnt allow the student to fully understand the application using real world software just recently dato the company that owns graphlab wa purchased by apple and you can no longer buy a commercial licence to the software despite this user can not use graphlab for commercial purpose therefore rendering the software completely impractical for professional the specialization is designed to help you get a job see capstone yet the software currently in place is limiting,1
1333,i have no doubt teacher are excelent professional in the area a well a great machine learning enthusiast however i did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and very expensive platform mostly because there are many other free package available for machine learning ok the platform offered make thing easier but if you really want to learn machine learning you can not be limited to a platform acting a a robot just using pre written function in a black box,1
1334,star because the theoretical part is ok but programming assignment are waste of time i m not here and paid to be trained to use something the instructor is trying to sell nor will i ever recommend this product for commercial use i will switch to other not recommended package in the later part of this specialization they should put the disclaimer for graphlab create in the specialization page so people can be aware of this besides the sound of that giraffe toy is really really annoying,1
1335,instructor or ta are not available in discussion forum and the course is focussed on promoting graph lab proprietary package of the course sponsor maybe you can have a look not beneficial if you are serious about learning ml,1
1336,like an advertisment why not use panda and numpy sk learn open source is more popular,1
1337,this course is to much about graphlab and not enough about the mechanic of machine learning,1
1338,having done some other machine learning moocs this course seemed rather basic to me and did not enjoy too much using non open source software for the programming assignment the material is nice in this sense i would have expected to default to sci kit learn and offer using graphlab create a optional,1
1339,i do not like this course being tied to a commercial product in my opinion it should be using an open source python library and not focusing on the dato product,1
1340,i am giving it a and am leaving the course because several of the recording in the second quiz don t work it is not possible to participate when there are technical difficulty like this if the recording worked i am sure it would be a very fun and interesting class,1
1341,the class are sometimes extremely boring and some thing are not clearly explained,1
1342,the course is good but it doe not ha lecture slide that is better for student to understand,1
1343,i ll say the same about this class a the rest of the specialization if you have the skill to complete this course then you don t need to take this course if you don t have the skill to complete this course you will not complete this course the course instruction is at foot level and the assignment are very challenging and the course will not teach you the skill required to complete the assignment i recommend the machine learning course from bill s colleague at university of washington that is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignment though still very challenging,1
1344,this course probably deserves star in a better maintained form but the entire specialization is not maintained the lecture have no production value basically it s a money pit that coursera is keeping up cynically it s a real shame because the syllabus correctly address a gap in most data scientist skill,1
1345,do not like the slide and the way it is explained compared with other ml course on cousera this one make me feel that it is more like a handbook dictionary instead of a tutorial to teach student if you already know it it would help you refresh the mind otherwise you might find it is just to show off how how complex and mysterious is the data science,1
1346,designed more for a child learning about poetry for the first time some of the fact about poetry aren t accurate the effort to make the class more engaging ironically only distracts from the course material the time spent attempting humor could have been spent on teaching but instead a lot of time is wasted by speaking down to the viewer like they are a toddler i did not finish this class a i couldn t stand the video,1
1347,one suggestion i give to you that please level of difficulty increase in a way that the learner not face to much thing in a single assignment so create assignment like that learner learn le thing but accurately for example in this assignment you only build a relation between class and marker on a map for only citymarkermap java class and in the next module you implement landmarker java and so on so please this is my request in the future make assignment in a way that the learner le thing but efficiently and accurately,1
1348,too fancy and the structure is not very clear not very much learned,1
1349,while the material is relevant the exercise required too much specific knowledge that wa not discussed in lecture for an experienced programmer most of the exercise were easy but i admit i had to look ahead on two of the project because the instruction were too lacking the final project wa too open ended and made me not want to finish this course overall i would not recommend this course,1
1350,the actual educational aspect of the course are interesting and insightful but the requirement to grade the work of others make this course a chore to get through if the material wasn t so useful i would have rated this course if the peer review requirement did not exist it would easily have warranted a rating,1
1351,a pure misapprehension it wa the course involved many interesting conception like how modern conception of civil society differ from hegel s and discussion of many really worthy person like pablo casals bronis aw huberman or ai weiwei but did not pertain music a such mere two peer reviewer per submission turned peer reviewing into a kind of lottery,1
1352,the subject of this course is awesome and very interesting but the effort that berklee put into it is nothing compared to what they give to student on their official website i completed a certificate with berklee online and i do not recommend this course but i do recommend berklee online course with written lesson and interactive work p s the video stop all the time and this make it harder to follow what the teacher is saying,1
1353,the lecture are good but in the assignment he asks for task that are not at all explained in the video for a beginner s course it is way too difficult and time consuming,1
1354,not very explanatory,1
1355,primarily focused on u politics and the u policy system discus mostly the problem with the u system of governance and it therefore not really useful for international viewer,1
1356,this course is a first time programming class using python this is not what i wa looking for i wanted an introduction to python for someone who know a some programming already also this teach python which no longer cut it especially for an intro class where you ll be taking further work it may have made sense when this class wa done year ago it doe not now the teacher wa very lively and engaging and i would enthusiastically recommend taking an online class with him but the class is out of date and not what i wa looking for,1
1357,the course material is fine in fact it good however i completed the entire course in hour whilst i have some basic programming experience i am by no mean an expert there really is very very little material in this course the assignment are also very simple and automatically graded the course fee are not particularly transparent i think the course is far too expensive for the content provided all of the other review i have seen for this course are a single line such a i liked the course a lot or something equally vacuous and unhelpful if you are a beginner i would suggest trying python for the absolute beginner by michael dawson if you have any programming experience you might be better with a more advanced course,1
1358,too easy and full of straw meaning thing not needed,1
1359,all the lecture are not clearly explained and a fresh person can not understand few thing and even in the assignment not mentioned properly what ha to be done and if not how to solve them and how can you imagine the learner know all the term related to web or the particular language you need to explain the new term which you use in the lecture and the lecture should be elaborate and should stress more on the basic thing like abcdefg here you need to explain a in detail b in detail c in detail so on then after in the next lecture you can move fastly not satisfied,1
0,good and interesting,2

109,excellent course very thorough introduction and ha only peaked my curiosity to go further in understanding this powerful technology,2
110,the course wa great i think it a great point to start in d printing it ha lot of information link interview and it easy to understand keep up the good work,2
111,very useful for understanding the basic of d printing technology,2
112,this is a fantastic course even if you ve never before heard of d printing or you ve been using a d printer for a while and i d highly recommend it to anyone interested in technology or futuristic concept the video in this course are very engaging there are a plethora of interview with people who are involved with the d printing industry who discus specific topic in d printing and each offer their view on the future of d printing all the different opinion and perspective really helped me understand the importance of d printing at both an industry and consumer level considering this is an introductory course it s very thorough and it consolidates and summarizes information that might take you age to glean off the internet even though i had a d printer before i took this course i learned a lot,2
113,very good intro to d printed,2
114,i enjoyed this class very much all the content wa very easy to understand and follow i love the fact that i can pick up the material on my phone or table through the app is very convenient before this class i had no idea d printing had been around for so long i thought it wa someone newer it s amazing to see all the different application it can be use for,2
115,hello my name is ahmed from egypt i am d hub mayor i think it s the first course in the internet which will give you the opportunity to know a lot of thing about d printing so stay tuned and register now if you interested in d printing cheer,2

117,practically oriented and brilliantly organized,2
118,it wa a perfect introductory course for those who really want to learn something about d printing i loved it,2
119,best place to get yourself up to date with the state of the art in d printing i really liked the revolutionary section where you get exposure to all the inter disciplinary idea floating around in the d printing landscape,2
120,thank you for this course very good course,2
121,this is a really great introductory course on d printing i wa completely new to the subject and in just two short module both the basic technique and some modern day application were explained in a really clear and engaging manner i wa also really interested to learn about the business example that made use of these new technology recommended for anyone who is interested in new and exciting technique,2
122,great endeavor you can now learn about the d printing technology at your own place,2
123,an excellent course i only wish the portion on non financial metric included some example or insight in how best to quantify non financial metric in do,2
124,excellent course first week were very technical but highly informative quite a bit of accounting knowledge is required to understand the work last week of lesson were more simple and intuitive to understand but overall a very insightful module,2
125,this is the first english course i have taken though at first it wa kind of difficulty because of language especially the term and profession knowledge it is a comprehensive course and i am still learning course concerned at school the course is really worth taking i have learned a lot and it stimulates my interest in accounting,2
126,thanks for your help,2
127,it wa fast but provided a good overview i would like some case to work and to apply the method to,2
128,a fantastic course,2
129,really fantastic and interesting intermediate accounting course,2
130,this is the best course that i ever studied it,2
131,this course is difficult for me since it requires extensive background of accounting study while my background is in hr and strategy however i grasped the opportunity to make up my finance and accounting related knowledge and passed the course finally after several time of trial and error the professor taught the course in a very interesting and fun way which could have been a boring class with lot of difficult and hard number but turn out to be a class full of fun and laughter i like the way the two professor are presenting the knowledge a well a doing the analysis thanks for providing such a course more course like this should be organized to benefit more professional or student in need,2
132,very informative course prof bushee is hilarious really like his teaching technique,2
133,department rigidity to information sharing a an ailment at middle and lower organizational level wa a notable issue,2
134,this course made me look at accounting in a very different way instead of common business schedule it actually became exciting to read and find out what wa really going on,2
135,most fruitful course for the most updated accounting analytics,2

592,the course is well detailed and well lectured,2
593,useful course separated into great topic and within a reasonable time frame,2
594,an exceptional course the breadth of material is wide and yet there is a lot of detail and some quite specific instruction the pace is good each module cover just enough before moving on to the next topic so it s engaging without being overwhelming there s a good range of discussion from economic theory practical case study and interview with farmer it build on what i ve learned elsewhere so will be useful for real world application,2
595,such an informative course,2
596,interesting course on agriculture and economics very useful to revise important economic concept and also to learn more about agriculture highly recommended,2

601,an excellent course and online experience coming from an industrial environmental management background this ha given me insight and interest,2
602,enriching content coupled with,2
603,wonderful course i recommend it to everyone in the agricultural space,2
604,a great short course delivered by one of the best agricultural economist in the world with a great publication history,2
605,great course have already learned so much and still hoping to learn more,2
606,great mental workout well explained but the coding challenge and bonus question are challenging enough to allow for a lot of growth even for more advanced student,2
607,i had a great time taking this course it wa a very good course in algorithm that explained the core concept really well rather than just providing a high level overview the assignment take some time but it aligns with what the instructor is teaching the instructor is absolutely excellent because he take the time to go through the math and iteration which help to develop a deeper intuition for these algorithm looking forward to completing his other course when i got time,2
608,course is brilliant but at least for me the completion took in average time more effort than expected by author hr week of course this is mostly due to my low experience with programming but still might be relevant for other learner who don t have much experience,2
609,it wa an awesome and challenging course and the lecturer mr tim roughgarden did introduced the gist that i need so of course i owe him a big thank thank you all,2
610,professor roughgarden explains everything clearly and is engaged in the topic his excitement about algorithm come though in his teaching,2
611,i thoroughly enjoyed this course i learned a great deal and particularly enjoyed the programming assignment looking forward to starting course,2
612,well designed and good to refresh the basic on many top algorithm,2
613,very useful course loved it,2
614,this course ha relatively few instruction about homework i believe more test case would be better though able to be found in forum besides lecture is really awesome thanks a lot,2
615,very good course in algorithm i bought the book to help me understand but the lecture make it way easier and thus much more fun to understand the analysis looking forward to complete the spec,2
616,i like this course a lot going to learn everything in the specialization,2
617,excellent course the statistical analysis wa a little too fast and overwhelming towards the end but overall i learned a lot,2
618,it is very important to learn algorithm a it is truly said it is heart of computer programming i am very happy and thanks for offering such a course to coursera and have just started hope will learn something so that it will help,2
619,the course wa pretty good definitely worth the money and better than i expected from an online course i thought it wa a little heavy with probability proof but that s probably because i struggle with stats,2
620,a very nice course,2
621,thank you so much i grown so much in the field of algorithm because of this course onto the next one,2
622,liked the style and intensity of the course,2
623,this is a best algorithm course i have ever done,2
624,very good course,2
625,it s an amazing introduction to algorithm i enjoyed listening to the lecture all the algorithm were explained in detail,2
626,the course wa quite useful and enlightening i wa a good start to learn algorithm,2
627,tim roughgarden teach with wit and depth speaking with idiomatic verve he injects life into algorithm,2
628,a must for wannable computer geek,2
629,the idea from this course are fun,2
630,very good review of divide and conquer algorithm however i only recommend for those who are willing to put in the hard work a i found it challenging,2
631,i m so glad that i ve taken this course this is really fantastic,2
632,very useful,2
633,this is a great course the teacher is very clear and the material is very interesting the programming assignment are interesting the problem asked are very simple but the input is generally too large to use brute force you really have to implement the algorithm presented in the video this make you realize how much smart algorithm can make a difference the level of the class is relatively high compared to other coursera course i ve taken if you want some serious training on algorithm look no further,2
634,challenging but insightful definitely worth it,2
635,excellent course i would recommend it to everyone who want to learn algorithm,2
636,awesome right now i know why algorithm are most important,2
637,sir tim roughgarden teach very straight forward and easy i like the course,2
638,cool class,2
639,exceptional material and teacher,2
640,challenging and fun,2
641,amazing course,2
642,very good course on algorithm a lot of term explained in detail with exercise,2
643,well structured well explained great course,2
644,very nice course,2
645,this course ha some great quiz question i d recommend it to people just for them,2
646,the math in this course is quite difficult but the professor doe a great job of explaining it in a very easily understood way,2
647,very challenging fast paced course,2
648,i wa very amazed with his really good lecture especially proving each algorithm s correctness and performance wa very interesting and stimulated my curiosity i also need to note that optional video for probability helped me a lot to understand this course i would like to recommend my friend definitely,2
649,best online course and one of the best course in programming,2
650,personally i would recommend this course to anyone who really want to learn how thing work in that sort of algorithm i found the assignment a little difficult but also extremely helpful,2
651,it s been a long time since i had so much fun like going back to school the course wa great the material is excelent the assignements interesting and challenging i really liked this course and am getting ready for the next one on the series,2
652,it wa awsome one of the best course and material regarding algorithm i have taken thanks a lot totally worth my time and money,2
653,great course with interesting assignment,2
654,this is great course,2
655,it s an amazing course aiming to high level and fast pace algorithmic thinker,2
656,i enjoyed this course it wa more challenging than the first one in the sequence especially in the graph search portion the last week are much more simple but it is still essential for any serious student of c to learn about data structure especially common and practical d such a heap and hash table,2
657,the professor is amazing he ha the ability to present the material very clearly concise and with a good dose of humour i would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in algorithm and data structure a an undergraduate or a professional,2
658,this wa another good one providing a slightly deeper dive than i had seen in other course the big revelation here for me wa the addition of bellman ford algorithm for evaluating shortest path in network graph that have some negative distance value between node i also like the approach to data structure high level then drilling down into increasing detail for level of interest i find it hard to say i understand a data structure based on interface and theory and i would have felt the certification meant more with at least a rudimentary implementation i guess that make me a coder at at heart i am about to jump into the next course of the specialization greedy algorithm minimum spanning tree and dynamic programming a with the two course before i am expecting new revelation about the kind of programming issue i ve been solving for more than fifteen year,2
659,a really good course,2
660,useful refresher,2
661,i learned a lot lot lot no more to say fantastic,2
662,very good course but i think this specialization focus on mathematical analysis we need to practice more,2
663,great course at least for people like me who lack of computer science background,2
664,i really enjoyed it perfect balance of practice and theory together with clear explanation i also appreciate the mentor effort that always answer any question and try to help thank you tim vassilis and arjit,2
665,this is a great course the teacher is very clear and the material is very interesting the programming assignment are interesting the problem asked are very simple but the input is generally too large to use brute force you really have to implement the algorithm presented in the video this make you realize how much smart algorithm can make a difference the level of the class is relatively high compared to other coursera course i ve taken if you want some serious training on algorithm look no further,2
666,nice course and exam problem i recommend this course if you want to understand the basic of graph tree and heap,2
667,this is great course and amazing refresher,2
668,super interesting course i have never seen in my lifetime watch me,2
669,i am really satisfied by the course just love the lecture and slide too,2
670,tim doe an excellent job explaining thing at depth and at the same time keeping thing interesting the quiz and programming assignment are well thought and carefully balanced v the material taught they force you to stretch just a bit beyond the lecture which is a good thing imho and there is a wealth of advanced optional material for the curious,2
671,i love how clear the video and note are and re watching them really helped a lot i wish there wa more discussion on the form though,2
672,it s challenging but interesting,2
673,very much to the point no nonsense good course,2
674,week wa significantly more time consuming than the others but it is still an excellent course overall recommended,2
675,well done that is the first english course i have finished,2
676,well done made a very difficult topic accessible,2
677,thank a lot,2
678,great course,2
679,the course is well structured clear and coherent the assessment are quite good too recommend it,2
680,excellent course if you are struggling with high school chem or need a good foundation for college chem this course move you through the concept and give you lot of practice problem,2
681,i did the course before it wa amazing,2
682,i am new to teaching ap chem and this class wa a great refresher for me i suggested that my student enroll,2
683,great i m chemistry and this course is very useful to remember all thing have you learnt in the university thank u,2
684,this is realy helpfull and interesting,2
685,itt s great nicely explained with step by step resolution of problem i loked it d,2
686,great explanation i am very satisfied,2
687,thank you for the course great,2
688,the course is very well organised and presented,2

690,it s great thank you for everything,2
691,i used this course a a significant portion of my preparation for the clep chemistry exam and passed today with an a thank you,2
692,this wa a fantastic course the teacher taught the material well and were entertaining in their teaching method i enjoyed that the lecture were easy to watch and i appreciated all of the practice problem,2
693,thank you for reviving my interest in chemistry,2
694,the subject are very well covered great explanation very recommendable,2
695,excellent lecture video with practice problem that are very helpful in recalling the chemical concept really wish this course could offer at least an soa so learner can be more motivated,2
696,thoroughly enjoyed this course problem and assignment are quite challenging but doable,2
697,very challenging well presented,2
698,this challenging course improves understanding of algorithm and is intellectually stimulating i learnt the theory behind algorithm and how they are applied to solve real world problem,2
699,awesome the professor is obviously very knowledgeable about the ancient greece history and it s a pity that i m done with the course i wish i could attend the full comprehensive version of it on top of the basic history i appreciated the comment on the research method the nuance in the interpretation of different event the presentation of additional element e g picture map artifact to support the lecture etc i wa sometimes rushing a bit to go through all the reading assignment but i m glad to know now what to read and where to search to get more information on the topic i think it s one of the good side effect of this course it motivates you to learn even more about the ancient greek thanks,2
700,very good the reading indicated helped to expand my knowledge of ancient greece every undergraduate student in history philosophy archeology etc must take this course,2
701,great course very touching and devoted instructor,2
702,excellent overview and introduction to greek history i am travelling to greece later this year and wanted to get a better understanding of greek history to appreciate the art literature architecture and site which i will be visiting this course wa both educational and entertaining i highly recommend and look forward to building upon the knowledge acquired in the course thank you,2
703,the course wa fascinating at first i must admit professor andy seemed quite dry at first but a i began to understand his wit i waited continually for him to deliver something extremely hilarious i still laugh when i think about the reference to bat whispering his understanding of the topic wa excellent and his ability to communicate such a tremendous span of critical western history efficiently and in an organized manner made the course valuable to me i learned enough to of course understand i knew little though i have written down several area i want to research on my own to expand my knowledge great course great lecture thank you for presenting it to u and helping u learn,2
704,a fantastic course very well presented and hugely informative,2
705,great course,2

714,even though the professor talk in a monotone voice i wa so fascinated by the course content that i wa able to overlook it,2
715,i like this course it cover a wide range of topic,2
716,i found wesleyan university s course the ancient greek rich in varied information professor andrew szegedy maszak s lecture are particularly thoughtful and the quiz are clear an altogether enjoyable well worth experience,2
717,very informative and filled with interesting tidbit i loved it,2
718,totally excellent and enthralling the subject matter is well treated and easy to follow the quality of the video are top a well i fell the the mix of lecture reading and quiz at the end of the week wa just right,2
719,excellent course i enjoyed it a lot it helped me to gain an overview over ancient greek history great lecturer,2
720,an excellent course one of the best i ve done at coursera i hope prof andrew szegedy maszak will give more course on this subject starting with the end of this course the th century bce progressing to the rd nd etcetera bce,2

722,perfect,2
723,the professor wa extremely knowledgeable and clear,2
724,wonderful course,2
725,i love the way this professor talk about event i learned so much,2
726,i love this class so much important history that can be related to current event and people i highly recommend everyone to take this course and think about it we still make the mistake these people did and the success are a part of our existence today instructor is very pleasant too,2
727,quality qu,2
728,inspiring instructor a lot of clarity in the lecture and some really interesting fact and story this course is almost like watching a great movie,2
729,thank you so much for conducting such a well paced course to the prelude of greek s history the course wa simply fascinating professor andrew s teaching style wa very detailed often humorous and also engaging it felt a if i wa really present in one of his lecture in the university classroom the provided reading assignment also immensely helped in gaining an in depth understanding of the course content the active discussion forum gave me the opportunity to fine tune my learning through q a and additional article for further reading provided by the very generous friendly and encouraging mentor looking forward to such a course in future with best regard saoumitaa g,2
730,i have learned many issue and insight and i am most satisfied,2
731,really interesting course,2
